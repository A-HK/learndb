Assembly language succinctly (2014),"By Christopher Rose

OVERVIEW

Assembly language is as close to writing machine code as you can get without writing in pure hexadecimal. Since it is such a low-level language, it’s not practical in all cases, but should definitely be considered when you’re looking to maximize performance. With Assembly Language Succinctly by Chris Rose, you’ll learn how to write x64 assembly for modern CPUs, first by writing inline assembly for 32-bit applications, and then writing native assembly for C++ projects. You’ll learn the basics of memory spaces, data segments, CISC instructions, SIMD instructions, and much more. Whether you’re working with Intel, AMD, or VIA CPUs, you’ll find this book a valuable starting point since many of the instructions are shared between processors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

    Introduction

    Assembly in Visual Studio

    Fundamentals

    Memory Spaces

    Addressing Modes

    Data Segment

    C Calling Convention

    Instruction Reference

    SIMD Instruction Sets

    Conclusion

Reflecting the author’s signature style, the writing is casual and conversational, but never at the expense of focus and pre­cision. It covers all aspects of the language (such as expressions, statements, types, functions, contracts, and modules), but it is much more than an enumeration of features.

Inside the book you will find

    In-depth explanations, with idiomatic examples, for all language features
    How feature groups support major programming paradigms
    Rationale and best-use advice for each major feature
    Discussion of cross-cutting issues, such as error handling, contract programming, and concurrency

Write you a Haskell (2014),"By Stephen Diehl

In 2014 I wrote a short tutorial about building a small imperative language in Haskell that compiled into LLVM. I was extremely happy with the effect the tutorial seemed to have, and the warm response I got from so many people was very encouraging.

I've done a great bit of thinking about what the most impactful topic I could write about in 2015 could be; and decided throughout this year I will follow up with a large endeavor for another project-based tutorial on building a simple functional programming language from first principles.

This is a nontrivial topic and is unfortunately very much underserved, the knowledge to build such a modern functional language is not widely disseminated among many programmers. The available resources most often discuss language theory in depth while completely glossing over the engineering details. I wished to write a project-based tutorial that included the engineering details and left the reader with a fully functional toy language at the end that could be extended for further projects.

We will build a small functional language called Fun which is a partial Haskell 2010 toy language; complete with a parser, type inference, datatypes, pattern matching, desugaring, typeclasses, higher-kinded types, monadic IO, arbitrary-rank polymorphism, records, Core language, STG intermediate language, lazy evaluation, interpreter, native code generator, a runtime, and several optimization passes.

As with most of my writing, this is the pre-edited rough cut version, which I will refine over time.","",book|http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/,programming-languages/haskell,"",,,,,

Hit Refresh (2017) - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"âAt the core, Hit Refresh, is about us humans and the unique quality we call empathy, which will become ever more valuable in a world where the torrent of technology will disrupt the status quo like never before.â â Satya Nadella from Hit RefreshâSatya has charted a course for making the most of the opportunities created by technology while also facing up to the hard questions.â â Bill Gates from the Foreword of Hit Refresh The New York Times bestseller Hit Refresh is about individual change, about the transformation happening inside of Microsoft and the technology that will soon impact all of our livesâthe arrival of the most exciting and disruptive wave of technology humankind has experienced: artificial intelligence, mixed reality, and quantum computing. Itâs about how people, organizations, and societies can and must transform and âhit refreshâ in their persistent quest for new energy, new ideas, and continued relevance and renewal.Â Microsoftâs CEO tells the inside story of the companyâs continuing transformation, tracing his own personal journey from a childhood in India to leading some of the most significant technological changes in the digital era. Satya Nadella explores a fascinating childhood before immigrating to the U.S. and how he learned to lead along the way. He then shares his meditations as a sitting CEOâone who is mostly unknown following the brainy Bill Gates and energetic Steve Ballmer. He tells the inside story of how a company rediscovered its soulâtransforming everything from culture to their fiercely competitive landscape and industry partnerships. As much a humanist as engineer and executive, Nadella concludes with his vision for the coming wave of technology and by exploring the potential impact to society and delivering call to action for world leaders.âIdeas excite me,â Nadella explains. âEmpathy grounds and centers me.â Hit Refresh is a set of reflections, meditations, and recommendations presented as algorithms from a principled, deliberative leader searching for improvementâfor himself, for a storied company, and for society.",,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/hit-refresh-summary/;book|https://www.amazon.in/Hit-Refresh-Rediscover-Microsofts-Everyone/dp/0062959727?tag=learnawesome-21,autobiography,Author of Hit Refresh,,,,,

The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon (2013) - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"The definitive story of Amazon.com, one of the most successful companies in the world, and of its driven, brilliant founder, Jeff Bezos.Amazon.com started off delivering books through the mail. But its visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, wasn't content with being a bookseller. He wanted Amazon to become the everything store, offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices. To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now. Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, giving readers the first in-depth, fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon. Compared to tech's other elite innovators--Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg--Bezos is a private man. But he stands out for his restless pursuit of new markets, leading Amazon into risky new ventures like the Kindle and cloud computing, and transforming retail in the same way Henry Ford revolutionized manufacturing.The Everything Store will be the revealing, definitive biography of the company that placed one of the first and largest bets on the Internet and forever changed the way we shop and read.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7264584-M.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-everything-store-summary/;book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17660462-the-everything-store,biographies,Brad Stone,,,,,

The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life (2008) - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"Here is THE book recounting the life and times of one of the most respected men in the world, Warren Buffett. The legendary Omaha investor has never written a memoir, but now he has allowed one writer, Alice Schroeder, unprecedented access to explore directly with him and with those closest to him his work, opinions, struggles, triumphs, follies, and wisdom. The result is the personally revealing and complete biography of the man known everywhere as âThe Oracle of Omaha.âAlthough the media track him constantly, Buffett himself has never told his full life story. His reality is private, especially by celebrity standards. Indeed, while the homespun persona that the public sees is true as far as it goes, it goes only so far. Warren Buffett is an array of paradoxes. He set out to prove that nice guys can finish first. Over the years he treated his investors as partners, acted as their steward, and championed honesty as an investor, CEO, board member, essayist, and speaker. At the same time he became the worldâs richest man, all from the modest Omaha headquarters of his company Berkshire Hathaway. None of this fits the term âsimple.âWhen Alice Schroeder met Warren Buffett she was an insurance industry analyst and a gifted writer known for her keen perception and business acumen. Her writings on finance impressed him, and as she came to know him she realized that while much had been written on the subject of his investing style, no one had moved beyond that to explore his larger philosophy, which is bound up in a complex personality and the details of his life. Out of this came his decision to cooperate with her on the book about himself that he would never write.Never before has Buffett spent countless hours responding to a writerâs questions, talking, giving complete access to his wife, children, friends, and business associatesâopening his files, recalling his childhood. It was an act of courage, as The Snowball makes immensely clear. Being human, his own life, like most lives, has been a mix of strengths and frailties. Yet notable though his wealth may be, Buffettâs legacy will not be his ranking on the scorecard of wealth; it will be his principles and ideas that have enriched peopleâs lives. This book tells you why Warren Buffett is the most fascinating American success story of our time.",https://learn-awesome.github.io/assets/book_covers/2054761.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-snowball-summary/;book|https://www.amazon.com/Snowball-Warren-Buffett-Business-Life/dp/0553384619?tag=learnawesome-20,biographies,Alice Schroeder,,,,,

The Lean Startup (2011) - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on ""validated learning,"" rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.",https://learn-awesome.github.io/assets/book_covers/10127019.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-lean-startup-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/LeanStartup;book|https://www.amazon.in/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898?tag=learnawesome-21,business,Eric Ries,,,,,

Sapiens: a brief history of humankind (2011),"Homo sapiens rules the world because it is the only animal that can believe in things that exist purely in its own imagination, such as gods, states, money and human rights.
Starting from this provocative idea, Sapiens goes on to retell the history of our species from a completely fresh perspective. It explains that money is the most pluralistic system of mutual trust ever devised; that capitalism is the most successful religion ever invented; that the treatment of animals in modern agriculture is probably the worst crime in history; and that even though we are far more powerful than our ancient ancestors, we aren’t much happier.

By combining profound insights with a remarkably vivid language, Sapiens acquired cult status among diverse audiences, captivating teenagers as well as university professors, animal rights activists alongside government ministers. By 2018, over 10 million copies have been sold, and the book has been translated into nearly 50 languages.",https://www.ynharari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/UK-Sapiens-e1486635350531.jpg,summary|https://neilkakkar.com/sapiens.html;video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzj7Wg4DAbs;video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTchioiHM0U;audio|https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2014/sep/15/sapiens-brief-history-humankind-yuval-noah-harari-podcast;book|https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0099590085?tag=learnawesome-20;video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2H9Q92RkfE,history,"",,,,,

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable (2002) - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Patrick Lencioni once again offers a leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two best-selling books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive. This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams. Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight. Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6872805-M.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary/;book|https://www.amazon.in/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756?tag=learnawesome-21,leadership,Patrick Lencioni,,,,,

The Art of Happiness (1998) - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"An updated edition of a beloved classic, the original book on happiness, with new material from His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Dr. Howard Cutler. Nearly every time you see him, he's laughing, or at least smiling. And he makes everyone else around him feel like smiling. He's the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, a Nobel Prize winner, and a hugely sought-after speaker and statesman. Why is he so popular? Even after spending only a few minutes in his presence you can't help feeling happier. If you ask him if he's happy, even though he's suffered the loss of his country, the Dalai Lama will give you an unconditional yes. What's more, he'll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that ""the very motion of our life is toward happiness."" How to get there has always been the question. He's tried to answer it before, but he's never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand. The Art of Happiness is the book that started the genre of happiness books, and it remains the cornerstone of the field of positive psychology. Through conversations, stories, and meditations, the Dalai Lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement. Together with Dr. Howard Cutler, he explores many facets of everyday life, including relationships, loss, and the pursuit of wealth, to illustrate how to ride through life's obstacles on a deep and abiding source of inner peace. Based on 2,500 years of Buddhist meditations mixed with a healthy dose of common sense, The Art of Happiness is a book that crosses the boundaries of traditions to help readers with difficulties common to all human beings. After being in print for ten years, this book has touched countless lives and uplifted spirits around the world.",https://learn-awesome.github.io/assets/book_covers/38210.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-art-of-happiness-summary/;book|https://www.amazon.in/Art-Happiness-10th-Anniversary-Handbook/dp/1594488894?tag=learnawesome-21,mindset,14th Dalai Lama,,,,,

"Thinking, Fast and Slow (2011) - Summary by FourMinuteBooks","Major New York Times bestsellerWinner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award in 2012Selected by the New York Times Book Review as one of the best books of 2011A Globe and Mail Best Books of the Year 2011 TitleOne of The Economist's 2011 Books of the Year One of The Wall Street Journal's Best Nonfiction Books of the Year 20112013 Presidential Medal of Freedom RecipientIn the international bestseller, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, the renowned psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacationâeach of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal livesâand how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and selected by The New York Times Book Review as one of the ten best books of 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow is destined to be a classic.",https://learn-awesome.github.io/assets/book_covers/11468377.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/thinking-fast-and-slow-summary/;book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26208390M/Thinking_fast_and_slow,psychology,Daniel Kahneman,,,,,

Zero to one (2014),"If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.

The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things.

Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.","",book|http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one,startups;entrepreneurship,"",,,,,

Factfullness - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"Factfulness: The stress-reducing habit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.When asked simple questions about global trendsâwhat percentage of the worldâs population live in poverty; why the worldâs population is increasing; how many girls finish schoolâwe systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess teachers, journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers.In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens. They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspectiveâfrom our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse).Our problem is that we donât know what we donât know, and even our guesses are informed by unconscious and predictable biases.It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. That doesnât mean there arenât real concerns. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.Inspiring and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, Factfulness is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world and empower you to respond to the crises and opportunities of the future.

Eugenia Cheng: How To Bake Pi,"","",audio|https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/eugenia-cheng-how-to-bake-pi/,mathematics;baking,"",2015,,,,
How to Bake Pi,"What is math? How exactly does it work? And what do three siblings trying to share a cake have to do with it? In How to Bake Pi, math professor Eugenia Cheng provides an accessible introduction to the logic and beauty of mathematics, powered, unexpectedly, by insights from the kitchen: we learn, for example, how the bÃ©chamel in a lasagna can be a lot like the number 5, and why making a good custard proves that math is easy but life is hard. Of course, itâs not all cooking; weâll also run the New York and Chicago marathons, pay visits to Cinderella and Lewis Carroll, and even get to the bottom of a tomatoâs identity as a vegetable. This is not the math of our high school classes: mathematics, Cheng shows us, is less about numbers and formulas and more about how we know, believe, and understand anything, including whether our brother took too much cake.At the heart of How to Bake Pi is Chengâs work on category theoryâa cutting-edge âmathematics of mathematics.â Cheng combines her theory work with her enthusiasm for cooking both to shed new light on the fundamentals of mathematics and to give readers a tour of a vast territory no popular book on math has explored before. Lively, funny, and clear, How to Bake Pi will dazzle the initiated while amusing and enlightening even the most hardened math-phobe.",http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780465051717.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23360039-how-to-bake-pi,mathematics,Eugenia Cheng,,,,,

Fashion: A Very Short Introduction,"Fashion is a gigantic global industry, generating some three hundred billion dollars in revenue every year, and playing a significant role in the economic, political, cultural and social lives of a vast international audience. Despite this, and perhaps in part because of its prevalence in the media, it is often denigrated as trivial and superficial, as a sign of vanity and narcissism. Written by a highly regarded authority on twentieth-century fashion, this Very Short Introduction offer a wide-ranging and revealing look at fashion that discusses everything from production and design, to couture and retailing, to the wider role of fashion in society. This lively book illuminates the structure of the fashion industry and the range of professionals involved in its creation, and it provides cogent insight into its historical, social and cultural contexts. It also sheds light on how fashion has developed, while raising questions about its ethical and controversial aspects, such as the use of fur, exploitative trading, and poor working conditions for laborers.",http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780199547906.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144596-fashion,fashion;design,Rebecca Arnold,,,,,

How should you flip your mattress to get the maximum wear out of it? How does Google search the Internet? How many people should you date before settling down? Believe it or not, math plays a crucial role in answering all of these questions and more.Math underpins everything in the cosmos, including us, yet too few of us understand this universal language well enough to revel in its wisdom, its beauty â and its joy. This deeply enlightening, vastly entertaining volume translates math in a way that is at once intelligible and thrilling. Each trenchant chapter of The Joy ofÂ x offers an âaha!â moment, starting with why numbers are so helpful, and progressing through the wondrous truths implicit in Ï, the Pythagorean theorem, irrational numbers, fat tails, even the rigors and surprising charms of calculus. Showing why he has won awards as a professor at Cornell and garnered extensive praise for his articles about math for the New York Times, Strogatz presumes of his readers only curiosity and common sense. And he rewards them with clear, ingenious, and often funny explanations of the most vital and exciting principles of his discipline.Whether you aced integral calculus or arenât sure what an integer is, youâll find profound wisdom and persistent delight in The Joy of x.",http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780547517650.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13356649-the-joy-of-x,mathematics;science,Steven H.

Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality (Hardcover)," A New York Times Science BestsellerWhat if you had to take an art class in which you were only taught how to paint a fence? What if you were never shown the paintings of van Gogh and Picasso, werenât even told they existed? Alas, this is how math is taught, and so for most of us it becomes the intellectual equivalent of watching paint dry.In Love and Math, renowned mathematician Edward Frenkel reveals a side of math weâve never seen, suffused with all the beauty and elegance of a work of art. In this heartfelt and passionate book, Frenkel shows that mathematics, far from occupying a specialist niche, goes to the heart of all matter, uniting us across cultures, time, and space.Love and Math tells two intertwined stories: of the wonders of mathematics and of one young manâs journey learning and living it. Having braved a discriminatory educational system to become one of the twenty-first centuryâs leading mathematicians, Frenkel now works on one of the biggest ideas to come out of math in the last 50 years: the Langlands Program. Considered by many to be a Grand Unified Theory of mathematics, the Langlands Program enables researchers to translate findings from one field to another so that they can solve problems, such as Fermatâs last theorem, that had seemed intractable before.At its core, Love and Math is a story about accessing a new way of thinking, which can enrich our lives and empower us to better understand the world and our place in it. It is an invitation to discover the magic hidden universe of mathematics.",https://learn-awesome.github.io/assets/book_covers/17290683.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290683-love-and-math,science;mathematics;autobiography,Edward Frenkel,,,,,

The Scratch Programming Language and Environment,"Abstract:

Scratch is a visual programming environment that allows users (primarily ages 8 to 16) to learn computer programming while working on personally meaningful projects such as animated stories and games. A key design goal of Scratch is to support self-directed learning through tinkering and collaboration with peers. This article explores how the Scratch programming language and environment support this goal.","",research_paper|https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1868358.1868363,programming-languages/scratch,"",,advanced,,,

Without Words: Mathematical Puzzles to Confound and Delight,"All real life mathematics is problem solving. And all those fascinated by puzzles are problem solvers at heart. But thinking mathematically is a skill we have to learn and one which it is easy to forget. Recreational mathematicians and students can practise problem solving in different ways. In this book solving puzzles is practised in a different way from most books they will have seen before:
• Readers get no clues to what the puzzle is about
• They may take hours or even days to work out what is being asked of them
• Even after that, some problems may have no solution
The result of this challenge is a really challenging book that will fascinate anyone interested in puzzles and recreational mathematicians in particular. This volume contains 36 puzzles ranging from quite easy to more difficult. The sister volume More Without Words: Mathematical Puzzles to Confound and Delight is also available – containing 36 more puzzles with more easy and fewer testing ones.",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1567257807l/31498845._SX318_.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31498845-without-words;book|http://www.jamestanton.com/?p=1605,mathematics,"",,beginner,,,

Remote - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"The âwork from homeâ phenomenon is thoroughly explored in this illuminating new book from bestselling 37signals founders Fried and Hansson, who point to the surging trend of employees working from home (and anywhere else) and explain the challenges and unexpected benefits.Â  Most important, they show why â with a few controversial exceptions such as Yahoo -- more businesses will want to promote this new model of getting things done.The Industrial Revolution's ""under one roof"" model of conducting work is steadily declining owing to technology that is rapidly creating virtual workspaces and allowing workers to provide their vital contribution without physically clustering together.Â  Today, the new paradigm is ""move work to the workers, rather than workers to the workplace.""Â  According to Reuters, one in five global workers telecommutes frequently and nearly ten percent work from home every day. Moms in particular will welcome this trend.Â  A full 60% wish they had a flexible work option. But companies see advantages too in the way remote work increases their talent pool, reduces turnover, lessens their real estate footprint, and improves the ability to conduct business across multiple time zones, to name just a few advantages.Â  In Remote, inconoclastic authors Fried and Hansson will convince readers that letting all or part of work teams function remotely is a great idea--and they're going to show precisely how a remote work setup can be accomplished.",https://learn-awesome.github.io/assets/book_covers/17316682.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/remote-summary/;book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17316682-remote,remote-work,Jason Fried,,,,,

The Aadhaar Effect: Why the World's Largest Identity Project Matters,"by N.S.Ramnath and Charles Assisi

Identification vs profiling; state welfare vs state surveillance; privacy vs transparency -- the idea of Aadhaar has bitterly polarized India since its launch eight years ago. No other project has captured the imagination of the people-or inspired such awe and anxiety-in recent memory.

Aadhaar began life with a singular mandate: offer an identity to those Indian residents who didn't have any. Along the way, it evolved into the welfare state's flagship technology and altered forever how government, business, and society interact.

The Aadhaar Effect is the story of the visionaries-bureaucrats, technologists, activists-who created or challenged India's biggest juggernaut. It is equally the story of humans conflicted about complex choices that may make the world a better place.

Award-winning journalists N.S. Ramnath and Charles Assisi dive deep into the 12-digit number that has touched 1.2 billion lives and counting-and in the bargain, made the world sit up and take note of India's ambition.",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1539542058l/42302997._SY475_.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42302997-the-aadhaar-effect,aadhaar,"",,,,,
Aadhaar: A Biometric History of India's 12-Digit Revolution,"by Shankkar Aiyar

A complex tale of idealism, negotiation and realpolitik records how a revolution was engineered

Aadhaar was born in July 2009, yoking modern technology and management expertise to political will. The biometric-based unique identification system, built by tech czar Nandan Nilekani and his team of innovators, was designed to enable subsidies and social spends reach their true destination, plug institutional corruption and save trillions of tax-rupees. In July 2017, Aadhaar is 1.15 billion identities and growing.

In Aadhaar: A Biometric History of India’s 12-digit Revolution, senior journalist Shankkar Aiyar traces the history of this ambitious, controversial undertaking. He speaks with President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Manmohan Singh, P. Chidambaram, Yashwant Sinha, Rahul Gandhi and others to document how politicians with diametrically opposed ideologies were equally determined to propel Aadhaar.

Aiyar maps how Aadhaar’s application expanded beyond its original intent. He researches its ups, downs and turnarounds; discusses the concerns of activists and bureaucrats on potential misuse of the database for state surveillance; raises the urgent need for a data-protection and privacy law and spells out the solutions.

An unusual contemporary dramatization, this book is a breathless ride through recent changes in India’s political and economic landscape.",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500580322l/35712946._SY475_.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35712946-aadhaar,aadhaar,"",,,,,

Syllabus: Scratch programming for kids,"I noticed that these days, a lot of parents are being pressured by edtech industry to buy paid courses on ""programming for kids"" which are all simply using Scratch with bad instructions. Worse, many of them are using industrial languages like Javascript or Python which are completely unsuitable for the purpose of pedagogy. So, I have put together this syllabus/sequence of high-quality learning resources (apps/free courses/articles/videos) that I followed for my own daughter with spectacular success.

We have a peer group of parents and children learning Scratch programming using this syllabus. If you'd like to join, come to [our Slack group](https://learnawesome.org/join_slack).

## Why learn Scratch programming?

Computational thinking skills may have a lot of practical value. It helps kids understand how computers work, and how to make new things with them. But [if you think programming is all about computers, you're wrong](https://twitter.com/nileshtrivedi/status/1261600393382883329). The core idea of programming is that a tiny set of simple instructions can be combined to produce immensely complex structures. We see this in cooking, knitting, chess, mathematics and much more. Your DNA, for example, is a series of instructions or a  ""program"".

But more importantly, programming is the only skill that lets you create ""interactive"" art. Other creators have ""readers"", ""audience"", ""spectators"" etc, but only programmers have ""users"". [If you haven't felt the joy of programming, you're really missing out](https://twitter.com/nileshtrivedi/status/1261601737854472192).

This joy is what should be the main motivation for teaching programming to kids. Not career success. We don't know what careers will be in vogue 15 years from now, but the joy of creation is an eternal human blessing.

Scratch is a visual programming language, built at MIT, that is used by children all over the globe. This visual language is in the shape of blocks (like Lego), and it allows its users to create online projects, games, apps, and many other things. The blocks eliminate the major source of frustration which comes from syntax errors. Scratch has a very active online community which makes this experience very engaging for kids, and they also learn collaboration and teamwork - besides figuring out how programs work.

Scratch, which is completely free, is what's being used by many edtech platforms. You don't need to pay a lot of money for paid courses because I have collected the best quality resources here for you and put them in a sequence that is not rushed.

In my opinion, it would be a mistake to start too soon with industrial languages like Python, Javascript because the child would be intimidated with a lot of details that only distract. Motivation is the #1 resource with the shortest supply. Do whatever you can to preserve it. I'd actually explore computer games like Age of Empires which provoke questions in their minds: ""I wonder how they wrote code for this game!"".

## Preparedness:

Can the child count things correctly? It's NOT easy. Suppose your boss wants you to work from 8am to 11am, and mop floors 8 to 11. Simple - it's one floor per hour, right?

Nope! There are 4 floors to mop (8, 9, 10 and 11) but only 3 hours to work (8-9, 9-10, and 10-11).

Whoa -- we count floors and hours differently? You bet. And somehow, if the boss said ""Mop floors 8 to 11 on April 8th to 11th"" everything would be ok.

To understand this, read [this article](https://learnawesome.org/items/b269d560-c519-4242-91d5-66ad547cc43b-learning-how-to-count-avoiding-the-fencepost-problem-betterexplained) under [Counting](https://learnawesome.org/topics/b49bc6fd-b9bc-46c9-a6d3-ebcef2f01b07-counting)

Does the child have some exposure to 2D coordinate systems? It's not a prerequisite, but will have to be discussed during the practice stage.
When you reach that stage, use resources from our [co-ordinate plane topic](https://learnawesome.org/topics/9d1d4677-7ebd-4077-9f1f-218806a340e9-coordinate-plane).

Is any one of the parents experienced with [computational thinking](https://learnawesome.org/topics/13b5f596-e6e4-4a45-81f1-843ff7b42d82-computational-thinking)? If not, they too should go through this Scratch course. Following along with the child is also fine.

Do you have a computing device at home (a desktop / laptop / tablet)?

Parents should read [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/) and [follow the Scratch team on Twitter](https://learnawesome.org/items/7a92e34a-982d-4d02-8c58-17de1de7f5db-scratch-team-scratch-twitter)

## Motivation and priming:

A lot of difficulty in programming is how it requires you to be very precise with language and instructions. Bringing this sensitivity is important. You can watch the [""Exact Instructions Challenge"" videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8).

It is also important to create the REASON/MOTIVATION to learn Scratch such as to create your own games. So, first you should explore games made on [Scratch website](https://learnawesome.org/items/3e9de8b8-ef9f-4a61-a091-6608d264b1a4-scratch-homepage). See what is possible with Scratch. Remember, kids want to DO interesting things, and not LEARN something.

## Experience:

Cooking is not very different from algorithms. You can start in the kitchen. Parent and child can enact any of the  [""Exact Instructions Challenges""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8) on their own. You might want to record a video, but no need to publish it anywhere.

After this, I recommend playing at least the first two levels of the programming puzzle game [Lightbot](https://learnawesome.org/items/2d6e8e6d-0e95-46d6-a4b8-0cf8d83c1634-lightbot). It's a free app which gives a highly-constrained and playful environment for algorithmic thinking that feels like playing a game instead of ""learning"". Remember, kids want to be able to ""do"" interesting stuff, not ""learn"" something.

Avoid [Scratch Junior](https://learnawesome.org/items/9d0fe359-b80a-4446-bdd5-c7e62afbbccc-scratchjr-home). It's better to stop after Lightbot and wait for them to be ready for main Scratch.

## Instruction and Practice:

Scratch is available both as a website and as an [app that works offline](https://scratch.mit.edu/download).

First try the [interactive online tutorial](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted).

More tutorials are available [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/ideas).

Now we are ready for a ""course"".  [The best one is this free course on edX](https://learnawesome.org/items/a2dbab26-0c93-49b7-ae52-105f312c075a-programming-in-scratch) which will explain all the concepts in detail. Complete it as far as you can. Remember to try things out. Coding, like swimming, can only be learnt by doing.

You can join other parents going through this syllabus in [our Slack group](https://learnawesome.org/join_slack). :-)

## Getting help:

Instead of helping you once, we will teach you how to find help yourself on the Internet:

- Try these [strategies for getting unstuck](https://learnawesome.org/items/8cb38a52-03a2-4587-8f20-efc404291590-getting-unstuck-strategies) here.
- Check on [Scratch wiki](https://learnawesome.org/items/a7b45674-d23e-4d65-bc57-f80c07cf1ed9-scratch-wiki).
- And the [Scratch forum](https://learnawesome.org/items/08fdd0dc-792d-49b2-a24d-a0b16050cedc-discuss-scratch).
- There's a [Facebook group](https://learnawesome.org/items/6afac218-ee56-4539-b9f8-24d8d83125d9-teaching-with-scratch-public-group-facebook).
- Tweet to [Scratch team](https://learnawesome.org/items/7a92e34a-982d-4d02-8c58-17de1de7f5db-scratch-team-scratch-twitter) or [Scratch Junior team](https://twitter.com/ScratchJr)
- Ask fellow Scratch learners in [our Slack group](https://learnawesome.org/join_slack)

## Performance:

- Basic: The student should be able to Create a game with her own idea and publish it on scratch website.
- Advanced: Complete this [series of Scratch challenges](https://learnawesome.org/items/0db431c8-f480-4a96-8907-85fef9eb6a4a-creative-computing-lab-at-the-harvard-graduate-school-of-education).

## Learn from the experts

- Let the kid play games on Scratch. They should know what ""apps"" are, before they get interested in how apps get made. Occasionally, they will get curious and click on the ""See Inside"" button to bypass a difficult game level. At that point, they are hacking in its true spirit. Count yourself as a successful parent at this point! 😄

- Watch Scratch tutorials on YouTube, such as how to create their own platformer game in Scratch. Be patient at this point though. Let them make simpler games, stories etc before reaching this slightly difficult level.

- Learn how to create custom blocks. This is a rough simulation of how functions work in industrial programming languages.

## Teach:

Your child should now teach Scratch to a friend or sibling. Teaching is one of the best ways to consolidate your [learning](https://learnawesome.org/topics/4e9769cb-5233-44fe-91d4-c49d601f6dbe-learning).

## What next after Scratch?

Frankly, there is no need to rush. Scratch alone can expose them to a wide variety of programming techniques, but if you do want to go forward, try these topics:

- [Snap!](https://learnawesome.org/topics/efde49a5-47bf-4689-88b1-303a7bca5f4b-programming-languages-snap) This adds two key features to Scratch: Lists as a first-class object (so you can introduce data-structures like tree, stack, queue etc) and higher-order functions. But it doesn't have a great UI or an active community like Scratch does.

- [Processing](https://learnawesome.org/topics/4cfd43da-19d7-40d4-b3d6-95297b1a31da-programming-languages-processing) is a textual language that still makes it easy to generate concrete, visual things like animations or games. It is important to work on concrete things because it shortens the feedback loop which is crucial for formation of concepts.

- [Computational Thinking](https://learnawesome.org/topics/13b5f596-e6e4-4a45-81f1-843ff7b42d82-computational-thinking)

## Help us spread the word.

[This picture](https://learnawesome.org/items/4755bf41-11ec-42b4-a696-cd57851e18bb-machine-learning-v-s-classical-programming) explains the difference between machine learning and classical program. Instead of figuring out the underlying mechanism of any phenomena (such as what causes cancer and what makes it show up in X-ray), the machine-learning approach just requires us to label the data (which x-rays came from cancer patients, and which ones came from healthy people). In this picture, this labeling is what is called ""Answers"".
Computer is very good at number-crunching.  If we provide sufficient data, it can detect all kind of correlations and patterns (i.e. ""Rules""). Those rules can then be used in classical programming way to look at unlabeled data, and make a fairly-accurate prediction.

We'll start with training basic regression models in Excel. Did you know that [most of us suck at Excel](https://learnawesome.org/items/ee3f3b19-849f-45c9-b2ad-fddd105d4bc7-you-suck-at-excel)? This is almost an hour-long video but worth a watch for anybody who spends significant amount of time in Excel.

Let's train our first machine-learning model, using nothing but Excel. [Here's a good article](https://learnawesome.org/items/a599ce44-88ae-4263-b0d2-f40f1fe01c23-regression-basics-for-business-analysis) that touches only a little bit of math.

That's right! Linear regression is an ML technique! If you'd like to go deeper into it, there are some resources on our [Linear Regression](https://learnawesome.org/topics/afb2268e-8386-43a9-8528-b6db6349d06a-linear-regression) topic.

Linear Regression is a simple model: It will only work in situations where the output variable is directly proportional to all input variables separately. No squares, or sines, or even reciprocals. This is why its utility is quite limited.
So, if you have y as the output variable that you suspect that it depends on 3 input variables, x1, x2, and x3, the model you are training is y = a*x1 + b*x2 + c*x3 + d. Excel will help you find the values of a, b, c, and d that represents the straight line that best fits the given data.

As long as the relationship is linear, the same technique will work - even for hundreds, thousands or even millions of variables. You'll just a more powerful machine to do the regression though. 

If you've done your first regression model in Excel, you should download [RapidMiner Studio](https://learnawesome.org/items/0144711f-6169-42bd-a65e-893642920a48-predictive-analytics-software-rapidminer-studio) 

This is a free tool that will let you visually build data pipelines for reading, cleaning, re-structuring data and training plus testing your models. The free version has a limit of 10,000 rows but we're recommending this because our goal is to understand ML, not get lost in the whole programming rabbithole.

You should now try to create a ""Decision Tree"" model in RapidMiner. They have a [catalog of video lessons here](https://learnawesome.org/items/c690fb51-0436-457f-ad45-c268f6afa14c-machine-learning-and-rapidminer-tutorials-rapidminer-academy/edit?item_id=c690fb51-0436-457f-ad45-c268f6afa14c).

By the time you reach the Create a model -> Apply a model -> Test a model -> Validate a model, you would have finished your first non-trivial machine learning problem.

[This article](https://learnawesome.org/items/c6000899-c51e-433c-83db-d264d73df2ea-machine-learning-is-fun-adam-geitgey-medium) will give you a very nice high-level, but not vague overview of machine learning.

Once you've completed the Decision Tree model in RapidMiner, you can try the other [built-in samples exercises](https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/getting-started/studio-samples.html) it has which cover a wide range of techniques. [MadeWithML](https://learnawesome.org/items/bcfa7ea8-1aa1-4752-9ad3-6fab43d0d775-made-with-ml) has good introductions to many of these topics.

Here are some other [interesting datasets](https://rs.io/100-interesting-data-sets-for-statistics/) to play with.

Now you're ready to get introduced to neural networks - which are all the rage these days. Here's an [interactive playground](https://learnawesome.org/items/bdc17d5c-771c-4b4c-95b3-6c2b80627aa7-neural-network-playground) to start with.

[3Blue1Brown has a nice 20-minute video about how neural networks actually work](https://learnawesome.org/items/59ffea74-ece9-43f4-a701-b323c095ae51-but-what-is-a-neural-network-deep-learning-chapter-1). Must watch!","","",machine-learning,"",,,,5.0,

Machine Learning Summer School 2020,"The Machine Learning Summer School (MLSS) Series
The machine learning summer school (MLSS) series was started in 2002 with the motivation to promulgate modern methods of statistical machine learning and inference. It was motivated by the observation that while many students are keen to learn about machine learning, and an increasing number of researchers want to apply machine learning methods to their research problems, only few machine learning courses are taught at universities. Machine learning summer schools present topics which are at the core of modern Machine Learning, from fundamentals to state-of-the-art practice. The speakers are leading experts in their field who talk with enthusiasm about their subjects.

MLSS 2020 in Tübingen, Germany
After having numerous discussions among the organizers, and gathering thoughts from our speakers and potential students, we concluded that holding the event this year in a virtual form is more beneficial than postponing it to next year, as there is no guarantee that holding it physically would be possible next summer. Therefore, the MLSS 2020 will be a virtual event between 28 June to 10 July 2020. Most of our lectures will be livestreamed on YouTube, depending on the speaker's agreement.","",course|http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/,machine-learning,"",,,,,

Fixing Sleep,"
--BLURBDOC--

I and people around me have been struggling on-and-off with sleep deprivation. Over the next couple of weeks, I intend to learn about [sleep](https://learnawesome.org/topics/663d33c6-338d-4c16-8f45-67ae74b0b69b-sleep) - how it works and how to fix it - using these resources.

- Why We Sleep (Book by Matthew Walker): ([summary 1](https://learnawesome.org/items/65884cd9-ef88-474d-9444-b5b5a20c087d-why-we-sleep-unlocking-the-power-of-sleep-and-dreams-summary-at-blas-com), [summary 2](https://learnawesome.org/items/f3bfcbbb-064d-4ee5-a4f4-4134f3f328bc-why-we-sleep-unlocking-the-power-of-sleep-and-dreams-2017), [critique](https://learnawesome.org/items/2ec6df50-4565-4305-9eea-cb29e31e1664-matthew-walker-s-why-we-sleep-is-riddled-with-scientific-and-factual-errors-alexey-guzey), and if possible, [the full book](https://learnawesome.org/items/4b8563a3-6fb9-439f-854a-7c19b2c68bb9-why-we-sleep-unlocking-the-power-of-sleep-and-dreams-2017))

A couple more book summaries to get alternate perspectives: 

- [Sleep Smarter](https://learnawesome.org/items/da6fea8b-4cfc-4157-8f58-6134993afd8d-sleep-smarter-summary-by-fourminutebooks)
- [The Sleep Revolution](https://learnawesome.org/items/5cacfc0e-5a9a-43e9-94b5-4fae19a81ed8-the-sleep-revolution-summary-by-fourminutebooks)

I will also start maintaining a [Sleep Diary](https://learnawesome.org/items/2f32e656-b597-49eb-baaa-a20c9aea3583-keeping-a-sleep-diary)

And a couple of research papers:

- [Brain Basics: Understanding Sleep](https://learnawesome.org/items/77b35cae-992c-40ad-b4ea-b65b65d8c094-brain-basics-understanding-sleep-national-institute-of-neurological-disorders-and-stroke) by NIH

As I start applying these ideas to fix my sleep, I will add more resources to this topic. If you'd like to join me and discuss this, join the [LearnAwesome slack](https://learnawesome.org/join_slack)","","",sleep,"",,,,,

Syllabus: Personal Finance,"## Introduction
Albert Einstein supposedly said:

> *Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world.*

We don’t know if he really said that but compound interest is indeed the most powerful force in the universe. And when it comes to money, investing, and personal finance, the most important lever that one needs to recognize and pull is the lever of compounding. 

## Step 1
[Watch this Khan Academy](https://learnawesome.org/items/4d4c31e1-f575-48da-969a-ad644ba7b50c-compound-interest-introduction-interest-and-debt-finance-capital-markets-khan-academy) video to refresh your  compound interest concepts. Pay special attention to the section where he talks about **how long does it take to double your money.**(The rule of 72) 

### Exercise
Compound interest is very counterintuitive for humans to wrap their head around. To get some intuitive understanding about compounding use this [compound interest calculator](https://financialmentor.com/calculator/compound-interest-calculator) and play by inserting some numbers. Observe the charts and table generated by the calculator. 

## Step 2
Join this Facebook group — [Asan Ideas for Wealth](https://learnawesome.org/items/de27a7be-0b90-443f-99ac-1bad5679e17a-asan-ideas-for-wealth-public-group-facebook) This is an active community. You can get answers to your personal finance/investing/money related questions here.

### Exercise
Browse through some of the discussions and comments. Don’t spend more than 15-20 minutes initially. The idea is to get access to this forum.

## Step 3
So, why are you interested in Personal Finance? Because you want to be a little more certain about availability of money in the future for your needs/wants. Right? So [watch this video](https://learnawesome.org/items/f60ffa9f-5dd2-49ce-82af-25cb43fc0352-a-e-assemble-step1-goals-dreams-nightmares-youtube).  (Start watching from 2:00 min onwards) 

### Exercise
Take as much time as needed to do the exercise suggested in it. The exercise could take a couple of hours or the whole weekend. At the end of the exercise you should have a fairly descriptive list of your goals, dreams, and nightmares. Describe the spreadsheet to your significant other or to someone you feel comfortable sharing your finances.

## Step 4
Remember, during the initial years compounding tests your patience and during the later years, your bewilderment. So, time to remind yourself about the miracle of compounding again. [Watch this video](https://learnawesome.org/items/a1350591-aa80-47ab-87d1-99fc5de51278-the-power-of-compound-interest-must-watch). Focus on the first 2min 40s — the story of the king and the chessboard.

### Exercise
Share the Chess Story with 3 of your friends. Then, crack open an excel spreadsheet, and do the math to come up with your own estimate of “the amount of grain on the chessboard.”

## Step 5
Simple doesn’t mean easy. It takes time to appreciate and develop good personal finance habits. Not days or months. It takes years. To ensure that your mind doesn’t forget the basics of good personal finance hygiene subscribe to these two blogs -

1. [Mr. Money Mustache](https://learnawesome.org/items/f731f093-dad6-4456-bbf2-90d722fe61fe-mr-money-mustache-early-retirement-through-badassity) 
2. [Get Rich Slowly](https://learnawesome.org/items/6776b6e1-fd61-4bdb-81a5-bccdac3e3de2-get-rich-slowly-personal-finance-that-makes-sense) 

## Assignment 1
Revisit the list that you created in Step 3. Now that you’re clear about your goals, to chart the path to your destination, you need to know where you stand today. To make an assessment of where you are today, [visit this link](https://learnawesome.org/items/72bc1636-f6b5-421e-9a6c-13e8451fb304-personal-financial-statement-for-excel) and follow the instructions to create an excel sheet which captures all your finances — your cash flows, assets, liabilities, etc. 

Capture every possible minute details. All your bank accounts, FDs, Mutual Funds, Insurance policies, Equity/Stocks, Real Estate, Loans, Income, Expenses — everything. If you’re doing this for the first time, it might be an overwhelming task but don’t cut corners. It’s important that you do it properly, even if it takes 2-3 days.

Remember, fixing your personal finances isn't a quick weekend activity. It will take time. 

Once you're done with this excel sheet, remove the numbers (or replace them with dummy figures) and share the excel template in the personal finance Slack group. This will help others in tweaking their own excel sheet and in the process you will also learn from others' templates.

## Step 6
Buy these two books and read them:

1. [Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://learnawesome.org/items/3c698e46-8577-4ea6-b056-f31b0a1e89a4-rich-dad-poor-dad)

2. [Richest Man in Babylon](https://learnawesome.org/items/cb8a617b-0d78-4644-b2e3-75b6d2d7756c-the-richest-man-in-babylon)

To begin, you could start with the book summaries:

1.  [Rich Dad Poor Dad book summary](https://learnawesome.org/items/2ac61164-9cfc-4d51-a80a-35e0d9c3f0d6-rich-dad-poor-dad-summary-by-fourminutebooks)

2.  [Richest Man in Babylon book summary](https://learnawesome.org/items/dc694591-26dc-498e-a832-8df5f9f2eccf-the-richest-man-in-babylon-summary-by-fourminutebooks)

Remember, the summary is just to get you started. It's important that you read the books also when you're done with the summaries. Don't worry if it takes time. Read the books slowly. There are no extra points for finishing the books fast. In fact, you may even have to read those books multiple times. Like compound interest, knowledge also builds slowly initially. Keep at it.

## Assignment 2

List down 10 most important lessons from each of the books. Share it in the Personal Finance Slack channel. 

The most effective (yet uncomfortable) way of learning anything is to teach it. So share your lessons on social media (WhatsApp, FB, Twitter, LinkedIn). The more you talk about it, deeper those learnings will go in your own mind and become a permanent part of how you think about money.","","",personal-finance,"",2020,,,5.0,

13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do,"The Ultimate Guide to Mastering Your Mental StrengthEveryone knows that regular exercise and weight training lead to physical strength. But how do we strengthen ourselves mentally for the truly tough times? And what should we do when we face these challenges? Or as psychotherapist Amy Morin asks, what should we avoid when we encounter adversity? Through her years counseling others and her own experiences navigating personal loss, Morin realized it is often the habits we cannot break that are holding us back from true success and happiness. Indulging in self-pity, agonizing over things beyond our control, obsessing over past events, resenting the achievements of others, or expecting immediate positive results holds us back. This list of things mentally strong people don't do resonated so much with readers that when it was picked up by Forbes.com it received ten million views.Now, for the first time, Morin expands upon the thirteen things from her viral post and shares her tried-and-true practices for increasing mental strength. Morin writes with searing honesty, incorporating anecdotes from her work as a college psychology instructor and psychotherapist as well as personal stories about how she bolstered her own mental strength when tragedy threatened to consume her.Increasing your mental strength can change your entire attitude. It takes practice and hard work, but with Morin's specific tips, exercises, and troubleshooting advice, it is possible to not only fortify your mental muscle but also drastically improve the quality of your life.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8844867-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Things-Mentally-Strong-People-Dont/dp/0062358308?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/13-things-mentally-strong-people-dont-do-summary/,psychology;personal-development,Amy Morin,,,,,

In A First-Rate Madness, Nassir Ghaemi, director of the Mood Disorders Programme at Tufts Medical Center, offers and sets forth a controversial, compelling thesis: the very qualities that mark those with mood disorders also make for the best leaders in times of crisis.From the importance of Lincoln's ""depressive realism"" to the lacklustre leadership of exceedingly sane men as Neville Chamberlain, A First-Rate Madness overturns many of our most cherished perceptions about greatness and the mind.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10357675-a-first-rate-madness;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/a-first-rate-madness-summary/,psychology;leadership,Author of A First-Rate Madness,,,,,

A Force For Good,"For more than half a century, in such books as The Art of Happiness and The Dalai Lamaâs Little Book of Inner Peace, the Dalai Lama has guided us along the path to compassion and taught us how to improve our inner lives. In A Force for Good, with the help of his longtime friend Daniel Goleman, the New York Times bestselling author of Emotional Intelligence, the Dalai Lama explains how to turn our compassionate energy outward. This revelatory and inspiring work provides a singular vision for transforming the world in practical and positive ways. Â  Much more than just the most prominent exponent of Tibetan Buddhism, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama is also a futurist who possesses a profound understanding of current events and a remarkable canniness for modern social issues. When he takes the stage worldwide, people listen. A Force for Good combines the central concepts of the Dalai Lama, empirical evidence that supports them, and true stories of people who are putting his ideas into actionâshowing how harnessing positive energies and directing them outward has lasting and meaningful effects. Goleman details the science of compassion and how this singular guiding motivation has the power to Â  â¢ break such destructive social forces as corruption, collusion, and bias â¢ heal the planet by refocusing our concerns toward our impact on the systems that support all life â¢ reverse the tendency toward systemic inequity through transparency and accountability â¢ replace violence with dialogue â¢ counter us-and-them thinking by recognizing human oneness â¢ create new economic systems that work for everyone, not just the powerful and rich â¢ design schooling that teaches empathy, self-mastery, and ethics Â  Millions of people have turned to the Dalai Lama for his unparalleled insight into living happier, more purposeful lives. Now, when the world needs his guidance more than ever, he shows how every compassion-driven human actâno matter how smallâis integral for a more peaceful, harmonious world, building a force for a better future. Â  Revelatory, motivating, and highly persuasive, A Force for Good is arguably the most important work from one of the worldâs most influential spiritual and political figures.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/Force-Good-Dalai-Lamas-Vision/dp/0553394894?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/a-force-for-good-summary/,spirituality;philosophy;religion;buddhism;psychology,Daniel Goleman,,,,,

Accidental Genius,"When it comes to creating ideas, we hold ourselves back. Thatâs because inside each of us is an internal editor whose job is to forever polish our thoughts, so we sound smart and in control, and so that we fit into society. But what happens when we encounter problems where such conventional thinking fails us? How to get unstuck?Â For Mark Levy, the answer is freewriting, a technique heâs used for years to solve all types of business problems, and generate ideas for books, articles and blog posts.Â Freewriting is deceptively simple: Start writing as fast as you can, for as long as you can, about a subject you care deeply about, while ignoring the standard rules of grammar and spelling. Your internal editor wonât be able to keep up with your output, and will be temporarily shunted into the background. Youâll now be able to think more honestly and resourcefully than before, and will generate breakthrough ideas and solutions that you couldnât have created any other way.Â Levy shares six freewriting secrets designed to knock out your editor and let your genius run free. He also includes fifteen problem-solving and creativity-stimulating principles you can use if you need more firepowerâseven of which are new to this editionâand stories of problems he and others have solved through freewriting.Â Also new to this edition: an extensive section on how to refine your freewriting into something you can share with the world. Although Levy originally taught freewriting as a private brainstorming technique, over the years he and his clients have found that, with some tweaking, itâs a great way to generate content for books, articles, and other thought leadership pieces.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Accidental-Genius-Revolutionize-Thinking-Through/dp/1605095257?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/accidental-genius-summary/,language;writing;thinking,Author of Accidental Genius,,,,,
Against Empathy,"New York Post Best Book of 2016We often think of our capacity to experience the suffering of others as the ultimate source of goodness. Many of our wisest policy-makers, activists, scientists, and philosophers agree that the only problem with empathy is that we donât have enough of it.Nothing could be farther from the truth, argues Yale researcher Paul Bloom. In AGAINST EMPATHY, Bloom reveals empathy to be one of the leading motivators of inequality and immorality in society. Far from helping us to improve the lives of others, empathy is a capricious and irrational emotion that appeals to our narrow prejudices. It muddles our judgment and, ironically, often leads to cruelty. We are at our best when we are smart enough not to rely on it, but to draw instead upon a more distanced compassion.Basing his argument on groundbreaking scientific findings, Bloom makes the case that some of the worst decisions made by individuals and nationsâwho to give money to, when to go to war, how to respond to climate change, and who to imprisonâare too often motivated by honest, yet misplaced, emotions. With precision and wit, he demonstrates how empathy distorts our judgment in every aspect of our lives, from philanthropy and charity to the justice system; from medical care and education to parenting and marriage. Without empathy, Bloom insists, our decisions would be clearer, fairer, andâyesâultimately more moral.Brilliantly argued, urgent and humane, AGAINST EMPATHY shows us that, when it comes to both major policy decisions and the choices we make in our everyday lives, limiting our impulse toward empathy is often the most compassionate choice we can make.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8814406-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29100194-against-empathy;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/against-empathy-summary/,psychology;philosophy;science;sociology;empathy,Paul Bloom,,,,,

Alibaba’s World,"**One of six of The Wall Street Journal's ""Best Business Books of 2015""**In September 2014, a Chinese company that most Americans had never heard of held the largest IPO in history â bigger than Google, Facebook and Twitter combined. Alibaba, now the world's largest e-commerce company, mostly escaped Western notice for over ten years, while building a customer base more than twice the size of Amazon's, and handling the bulk of e-commerce transactions in China. How did it happen? And what was it like to be along for such a revolutionary ride?In Alibaba's World, author Porter Erisman, one of Alibaba's first Western employees and its head of international marketing from 2000 to 2008, shows how Jack Ma, a Chinese schoolteacher who twice failed his college entrance exams, rose from obscurity to found Alibaba and lead it from struggling startup to the world's most dominant e-commerce player. He shares stories of weathering the dotcom crash, facing down eBay and Google, negotiating with the unpredictable Chinese government, and enduring the misguided advice of foreign experts, all to build the behemoth that's poised to sweep the ecommerce world today. And he analyzes Alibaba's role as a harbinger of the new global business landscapeâwith its focus on the East rather than the West, emerging markets over developed ones, and the nimble entrepreneur over the industry titan. As we face this near future, the story of Alibabaâand its inevitable descendantsâis both essential and instructive.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23014882-alibaba-s-world;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/alibabas-world-summary/,business;china;entrepreneurship,Porter Erisman,,,,,

An Audience Of One,"The creator of the Unmistakable Creative podcast makes a counterintuitive argument: By focusing your creative work on pleasing yourself, you can increase your productivity, happiness, and (eventually, paradoxically) the size of your audience.Creating for your own pleasure--whether you're writing a novel, composing songs, or painting a landscape--can seem pointless. It's tempting to focus on pursuing money and fame, rather than the process itself. But as Srini Rao warns, creating then turns into a chore that can harm your self-esteem and suck the pleasure out of life, rather than being a source of joy.Rao, host of the podcast The Unmistakable Creative, argues that we should counter this thinking by intentionally creating art for ourselves alone--an audience of one. In this book he shares the fascinating true stories of creatives who took this path, along with actionable tips and the research of creativity experts. You'll learn, for example:* How Oprah's intentional focus on her own work rather than the opinions of everyone else catapulted her into one of the most popular talk shows of all time.* How being process-driven can not only help you produce more work, but can make you happier outside of your creative time.* How to put together a creative ""team of rivals"" whose feedback can help you hone your craft and filter out useless feedback.By playing to an audience of one, we can find more happiness, increased productivity, and a greater sense of community.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26974345M/An_audience_of_one;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/an-audience-of-one-summary/,writing;art,"Rao, Srinivas (Host of The Unmistakable Creative Podcast)",,,,,

As A Man Thinketh,"2018 Reprint of the 1913 Edition. As a Man Thinketh was first published in 1903. In it, Allen describes how man is the creator and shaper of his destiny by the thoughts which he thinks. We rise and fall in exact accordance with the character of the thoughts which we entertain. Our environment is the result of the thoughts that we harbor and the behavior that our thoughts bring about. Part of the New Thought Movement, Allen reveals the secrets to having the most fulfilling existence possible, guided by a proper understanding and appreciate of how thought shapes our lives. Allen advises on how to better manage our thoughts and how to direct them into more constructive behavior. Though written more than one hundred years ago, the language and resonance of this classic still hold up today, inviting each of us to reflect not on the world and others, but our own thoughts and how to regain their possession. The title for the essay comes from the Bible: ""As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,"" Proverbs, chapter 23, verse 7. In more than a century, As A Man Thinketh has become an inspirational classic, selling millions of copies worldwide and bringing faith, inspiration, and self- healing to all who have encountered it.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/As-Man-Thinketh-James-Allen/dp/1684222095?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/as-a-man-thinketh-summary/,philosophy;personal-development;thinking,Author of As A Man Thinketh,,,,,
At Home - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"From one of our most beloved authors, a fascinating excursion into the history behind the place we call homeânow richly illustrated with more than two hundred images in full colorBill Bryson and his family live in a Victorian parsonage in a part of England where nothing of any great significance has happened since the Romans decamped. But, struck one day by the thought that âhistory mostly is masses of people doing ordinary things,â he began to consider how very little he knew about the ordinary things in lifeâmost of them found inside his front door. At Home is the bestselling story of Brysonâs room-by-room journey around his house, a history of the world written without leaving home. The bathroom provides the occasion for the history of hygiene; the bedroom for an account of sex, death, and sleep; the kitchen for a discussion of nutrition and the spice trade. From architecture to electricity, from food preservation to epidemics, from the telephone to the Eiffel Tower, from crinolines to toiletsâand the brilliant, creative, and often eccentric minds behind themâBryson demonstrates that whatever happens in the world ends up in our houses, in the paint and the pipes and the pillows and every item of furniture.In this handsome new edition of At Home, Brysonâs sparkling prose is enhanced by some two hundred carefully curated full-color images. Selected from a wide array of sources, these illustrations vividly bring his fascinating and entertaining domestic adventure to visual life. Bryson has one of the liveliest, most inquisitive minds on the planet, and he is a master at turning the seemingly mundane into an occasion for the most diverting exposition imaginable. When youâve finished this book, youâll see your houseâand your daily lifeâin a new and revelatory light.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7565147-M.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/at-home-summary/;book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7507825-at-home,history,Bill Bryson,,,,,

Attached,"We rely on science to tell us everything from what to eat to when and how long to exercise, but what about relationships? Is there a scientific explanation for why some people seem to navigate relationships effortlessly, while others struggle? According to psychiatrist and neuroscientist Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, the answer is a resounding ""yes.""In Attached, Levine and Heller reveal how an understanding of adult attachment-the most advanced relationship science in existence today-can help us find and sustain love. Pioneered by psychologist John Bowlby in the 1950s, the field of attachment posits that each of us behaves in relationships in one of three distinct ways: Anxious people are often preoccupied with their relationships and tend to worry about their partner's ability to love them back Avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness. Secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving.In this book Levine and Heller guide readers in determining what attachment style they and their mate (or potential mate) follow, offering a road map for building stronger, more fulfilling connections with the people they love.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8620497-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25540563M/Attached;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/attached-summary/,psychology;relationships,Amir Levine,,,,,

Aware,"
  This groundbreaking new book from New York Times bestselling author Daniel Siegel, M.D., introduces readers to his pioneering meditation practice that draws on cutting-edge brain science.
In Aware, New York Times bestselling author Daniel J. Siegel introduces readers to his life-changing meditation program, The Wheel of Awareness. Whether the reader has no experience with reflective practices or is an experienced practitioner, Aware provides practical instruction for mastering this brilliant tool for cultivating more focus, presence, and peace in one's day-to-day life.Dr. Siegel reveals in this fascinating book how mindfulness practices such as meditation have the capacity to, quite literally, re-wire our brains as ""neurons that fire together wire together."" According to Siegel, fear, anxiety, and stress in our lives can tend to send our thoughts traveling down the same neural pathways. Our thinking can become rigid or disjointed. Through developing a Wheel of Awareness practice, however, we strengthen our minds by expanding our awareness of how our mind is actually functioning and - in turn - we are able to gently coax our thoughts to travel in healthier, more productive directions.An in-depth look at the brain science that underlies meditation's effectiveness, Aware will guide you in developing a meditation practice that will inspire you to be more focused and present in your life as well as more emotionally resilient in the face of stress and the challenges life may throw your way.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26966421M/Aware;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/aware-summary/,psychology;meditation,Author of Brainstorm,,,,,

Be Fearless,"Philanthropist, investor, and technology pioneer Jean Case brings to life the five Be Fearless principles common to the people and organizations that change the world.This book is a call to action for those seeking to live extraordinary lives and bring about transformational change.  When National Geographic Chairman Jean Case set out to investigate the core qualities of great change makers, past and present, from inventors to revolutionaries, she found five surprising traits all had in common. They werenât wealth, privilege, or even genius. It was that all of these exceptional men and women chose to make a âbig bet,â take bold risks, learn from their failures, reach beyond their bubbles, and let urgency conquer fear.  Throughout Be Fearless, Jean vividly illustrates these principles through storytellingâfrom her own transformational life experiences, to Jane Goodallâs remarkable breakthroughs in understanding and protecting chimpanzees, to celebrity chef JosÃ© AndrÃ©sâ decision to be a âfirst responderâ and take his kitchen to the sites of devastating hurricanes to feed the hungry, to Bryan Stevensonâs ambitious efforts to end incarceration inequities, and more. She shares new insights to stories you might think you knowâlike AirBnBâs tale of starting from scratch to transform the hospitality industry, to John F. Kennedyâs history-making moonshotâand gems from changemakers youâve never heard of.  Weaving together storytelling, practical tips and inspiration, Be Fearless will teach you how to put the five fearless principles to work so that they too can spark the sorts of remarkable breakthroughs that change the world.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8798180-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27333582M/Be_Fearless;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/be-fearless-summary/,personal-development,Jean Case,,,,,

Black Box Thinking,"An eye-opening, Gladwellian look at the power of a positive attitude toward failure and its profound impact on our success in any field.In the airline industry, failure is taken seriously. Every aircraft is equipped with an almost indestructible black box. When there is an accident, the box is opened, the data is analyzed, and the reason for the accident excavated. This ensures that procedures are adapted so that the same mistake doesnât happen again. With this method, the industry has created an astonishing safety record.For pilots working in a safety-critical industry, getting it wrong can have deadly consequences. But most of us have a relationship with failure that impedes progress, halts innovation, and damages our lives. We donât acknowledge it or learn from it âthough we often think we do.Moving from anthropology to psychology and from history to complexity theory, Matthew Syed explains why even when we think we have 20/20 hindsight, our visionâs still fuzzy. He offers a radical new idea: that the most important determinant of success in any field, whether sports, business, or life, is an acknowledgment of failure and a willingness to engage with it. This is how we learn, progress and excel. This approach explains everything from biological evolution and the efficiency of markets to the success of the Mercedes F1 team and the mindset of David Beckham.Using a cornucopia of interviews, gripping stories, and sharp-edged science, Syed explores the intimate relationship between failure and success, and shows why we need to transport black box thinking into our own lives. If we wish to unleash our potential, we must diagnose and break free of our failures. Part manifesto for change, part intellectual adventure, this groundbreaking book reveals how to do both.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611735-black-box-thinking;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/black-box-thinking-summary/,thinking,Author of Black Box Thinking,,,,,
Blink - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables. Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6383854-M.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/blink-summary/;book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23273215M/Blink,psychology,Malcolm Gladwell,,,,,

According to Siegel, during adolescence we learn vital skills, such as how to leave home and enter the larger world, connect deeply with others, and safely experiment and take risks. Drawing on important new research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology, Siegel explores exciting ways in which understanding how the brain functions can improve the lives of adolescents, making their relationships more fulfilling and less lonely and distressing on both sides of the generational divide.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707532-brainstorm;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/brainstorm-summary/,parenting;psychology;adolescence,Author of Brainstorm,,,,,

Breakfast With Socrates,"
  
 Have breakfast with Socrates, go to work with Nietzsche, head to the gym with Foucault, then have sex with Ovid (or Simone de Beauvoir).   Former Oxford Philosophy Fellow Robert Rowland Smith whisks you through an ordinary day with history's most extraordinary thinkers, explaining what they might have to say about your routine. From waking up in the morning through traveling to work, shopping, eating, going to a party, falling asleep, and dreaming, Smith connects our most mundane habits to the wider world of ideas.  Start with waking up: What does it really mean to be awake? How do we know we're not still dreaming? Descartes argues that if you're able to doubt whether you're awake, you are at least thinking, and so you probably exist -- no small achievement for first thing in the morning. Or take going to the gym: As you toil on the treadmill, is your panting a sign of virtue or of vice, of healthy exertion or of unhealthy narcissism? Working out is a version of what Max Weber called the Protestant work ethic -- a kind of spiritual exercise, it also leads to worldly vanity.  With dry wit and marvelous invention, Smith draws on philosophy, literature, art, politics, and psychology to wake us up to a stunning range of ideas about how to live. Neither breakfast, lunch, nor dinner will ever be the same again.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7965588-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Breakfast-Socrates-Extraordinary-Philosophical-Ordinary/dp/1439148686?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/breakfast-with-socrates-summary/,philosophy,Robert Rowland Smith,,,,,

Can’t Hurt Me,"For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare â poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him âThe Fittest (Real) Man in America.â  In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8305903-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/cant-hurt-me-summary/,psychology;personal-development,David Goggins,,,,,

Chaos Monkeys,"Liarâs Poker meets The Social Network in an irreverent exposÃ© of life inside the tech bubble, from industry provocateur Antonio GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez, a former Twitter advisor, Facebook product manager and startup founder/CEO.The reality is, Silicon Valley capitalism is very simple:Investors are people with more money than time.Employees are people with more time than money.Entrepreneurs are the seductive go-between.Marketing is like sex: only losers pay for it.Â Imagine a chimpanzee rampaging through a datacenter powering everything from Google to Facebook. Infrastructure engineers use a software version of this âchaos monkeyâ to test online servicesâ robustnessâtheir ability to survive random failure and correct mistakes before they actually occur. Tech entrepreneurs are societyâs chaos monkeys, disruptors testing and transforming every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and lodging (AirBnB) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder). One of Silicon Valleyâs most audacious chaos monkeys is Antonio GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez.After stints on Wall Street and as CEO of his own startup, GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez joined Facebookâs nascent advertising team, turning its usersâ data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark âZuckâ Zuckerberg. Forced out in the wake of an internal product war over the future of the companyâs monetization strategy, GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez eventually landed at rival Twitter. He also fathered two children with a woman he barely knew, committed lewd acts and brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg's desk), lived on a sailboat, raced sport cars on the 101, and enthusiastically pursued the life of an overpaid Silicon Valley wastrel.Now, this gleeful contrarian unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing and reveals how it is invading our lives and shaping our future. Weighing in on everything from startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetization and digital âprivacy,â GarcÃ­a MartÃ­nez shares his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a humorous, subversive tour of the fascinatingly insular tech industry. Chaos Monkeys lays bare the hijinks, trade secrets, and power plays of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists, accidental tourists, and money cowboys who are revolutionizing our world. The question is, will we survive?",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27212416M/Chaos_monkeys;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/chaos-monkeys-summary/,business,Antonio García Martínez,,,,,

Counterclockwise,"If we could turn back the clock psychologically, could we also turn it back physically? For more than thirty years, award-winning social psychologist Ellen Langer has studied this provocative question, and now, in Counterclockwise, she presents the answer: Opening our minds to what's possible, instead of presuming impossibility, can lead to better health-at any age.Drawing on landmark work in the field and her own body of colorful and highly original experiments-including the first detailed discussion of her ""counterclockwise"" study, in which elderly men lived for a week as though it was 1959 and showed dramatic improvements in their hearing, memory, dexterity, appetite, and general well-being-Langer shows that the magic of rejuvenation and ongoing good health lies in being aware of the ways we mindlessly react to social and cultural cues. Examining the hidden decisions and vocabulary that shape the medical world (""chronic"" versus ""acute,"" ""cure"" versus ""remission""), the powerful physical effects of placebos, and the intricate but often defeatist ways we define our physical health, Langer challenges the idea that the limits we assume and impose on ourselves are real. With only subtle shifts in our thinking, in our language, and in our expectations, she tells us, we can begin to change the ingrained behaviors that sap health, optimism, and vitality from our lives. Improved vision, younger appearance, weight loss, and increased longevity are just four of the results that Langer has demonstrated.Immensely readable and riveting, Counterclockwise offers a transformative and bold new paradigm: the psychology of possibility. A hopeful and groundbreaking book by an author who has changed how people all over the world think and feel, Counterclockwise is sure to join Mindfulness as a standard source on new-century science and healing.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5923961-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Counterclockwise-Mindful-Health-Power-Possibility/dp/1501265288?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/counterclockwise-summary/,psychology;health,Ellen J.

Creative Schools,"A revolutionary reappraisal of how to educate our children and young people by Ken Robinson, the New York Times bestselling author of The Element and Finding Your ElementÂ Ken Robinson is one of the worldâs most influential voices in education, and his 2006 TED Talk on the subject is the most viewed in the organizationâs history. Now, the internationally recognized leader on creativity and human potential focuses on one of the most critical issues of our time: how to transform the nationâs troubled educational system. At a time when standardized testing businesses are raking in huge profits, when many schools are struggling, and students and educators everywhere are suffering under the strain, Robinson points the way forward. He argues for an end to our outmoded industrial educational system and proposes a highly personalized, organic approach that draws on todayâs unprecedented technological and professional resources to engage all students, develop their love of learning, and enable them to face the real challenges of the twenty-first century. Filled with anecdotes, observations and recommendations from professionals on the front line of transformative education, case histories, and groundbreaking researchâand written with Robinsonâs trademark wit and engaging styleâCreative Schools will inspire teachers, parents, and policy makers alike to rethink the real nature and purpose of education.From the Hardcover edition.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Creative-Schools-Grassroots-Revolution-Transforming/dp/0143108069?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/creative-schools-summary/,education;teaching;parenting,Author of Creative Schools,,,,,

Daring Greatly,"The #1 New York Times bestseller, now in paperback. From thought leader Dr. BrenÃ© Brown, a transformative new vision for the way we lead, love, work, parent, and educate that teaches us the power of vulnerability.Â âIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.ââTheodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable or to dare greatly. Based on twelve years of pioneering research, Dr. BrenÃ© Brown dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and argues that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage.Brown explains how vulnerability is both the core of difficult emotions like fear, grief, and disappointment, and the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, empathy, innovation, and creativity. She writes: âWhen we shut ourselves off from vulnerability, we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives.âDaring Greatly is not about winning or losing. Itâs about courage. In a world where ânever enoughâ dominates and feeling afraid has become second nature, vulnerability is subversive. Uncomfortable. Itâs even a little dangerous at times. And, without question, putting ourselves out there means thereâs a far greater risk of getting criticized or feeling hurt. But when we step back and examine our lives, we will find that nothing is as uncomfortable, dangerous, and hurtful as standing on the outside of our lives looking in and wondering what it would be like if we had the courage to step into the arenaâwhether itâs a new relationship, an important meeting, the creative process, or a difficult family conversation. Daring Greatly is a practice and a powerful new vision for letting ourselves be seen.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8314266-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26630004M/Daring_Greatly_How_the_Courage_to_Be_Vulnerable_Transforms_the_Way_We_Live_Love_Parent_and_Lead;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/daring-greatly-summary/,psychology;personal-development,Brené Brown,,,,,

Deep Thinking,"Garry Kasparov's 1997 chess match against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue was a watershed moment in the history of technology. It was the dawn of a new era in artificial intelligence: a machine capable of beating the reigning human champion at this most cerebral game.   That moment was more than a century in the making, and in this breakthrough book, Kasparov reveals his astonishing side of the story for the first time. He describes how it felt to strategize against an implacable, untiring opponent with the whole world watching, and recounts the history of machine intelligence through the microcosm of chess, considered by generations of scientific pioneers to be a key to unlocking the secrets of human and machine cognition. Kasparov uses his unrivaled experience to look into the future of intelligent machines and sees it bright with possibility. As many critics decry artificial intelligence as a menace, particularly to human jobs, Kasparov shows how humanity can rise to new heights with the help of our most extraordinary creations, rather than fear them. Deep Thinking is a tightly argued case for technological progress, from the man who stood at its precipice with his own career at stake.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Thinking-Machine-Intelligence-Creativity/dp/1541773640?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/deep-thinking-summary/,science;games;chess;thinking,Author of Deep Thinking,,,,,

Design To Grow,"Expert advice from Coca-Colaâs vice president of Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Learn how Coca-Cola uses design to grow its business by combining the advantages of scale with the agility to respond to fast-changing market conditions.In todayâs world, every company is at risk of having a âKodak Momentââwatching its industry and the competitive advantages it has developed over years, even decades, vanish overnight. The reason? An inability to adapt quickly to new business realities. Established companies are at risk, but itâs no easier being an agile startup, because most of those fail due to their inability to scale.

Digital Minimalism,"The key to living well in a high tech world is to spend much less time using technology.Georgetown computer scientist Cal Newport's Deep Work sparked a movement around the idea that unbroken concentration produces far more value than the electronic busyness that defines the modern work day. But his readers had an urgent follow-up question: What about technology in our personal lives?In recent years, our culture's relationship with personal technology has transformed from something exciting into something darker. Innovations like smartphones and social media are useful, but many of us are increasingly troubled by how much control these tools seem to exert over our daily experiences--including how we spend our free time and how we feel about ourselves.In Digital Minimalism, Newport proposes a bold solution: a minimalist approach to technology use in which you radically reduce the time you spend online, focusing on a small set of carefully-selected activities while happily ignoring the rest.He mounts a vigorous defense for this less-is-more approach, combining historical examples with case studies of modern digital minimalists to argue that this philosophy isn't a rejection of technology, but instead a necessary realignment to ensure that these tools serve us, not the other way around.To make these principles practical, he takes us inside the growing subculture of digital minimalists who have built rich lives on a foundation of intentional technology use, and details a decluttering process that thousands have already used to simplify their online lives. He also stresses the importance of never clicking ""like,"" explores the underappreciated value of analog hobbies, and draws lessons from the ""attention underground""--a resistance movement fighting the tech companies' attempts to turn us into gadget addicts.Digital Minimalism is an indispensable guide for anyone looking to reclaim their life from the alluring diversions of the digital world.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8507540-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26832542M/Digital_Minimalism;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/digital-minimalism-summary/,productivity;technology;psychology;personal-development,Cal Newport,,,,,
Digital Renaissance,"How digital technology is upending the traditional creative industries--and why that might be a good thingThe digital revolution poses a mortal threat to the major creative industries--music, publishing, television, and the movies. The ease with which digital files can be copied and distributed has unleashed a wave of piracy with disastrous effects on revenue. Cheap, easy self-publishing is eroding the position of these gatekeepers and guardians of culture. Does this revolution herald the collapse of culture, as some commentators claim? Far from it. In Digital Renaissance, Joel Waldfogel argues that digital technology is enabling a new golden age of popular culture, a veritable digital renaissance.By reducing the costs of production, distribution, and promotion, digital technology is democratizing access to the cultural marketplace. More books, songs, television shows, and movies are being produced than ever before. Nor does this mean a tidal wave of derivative, poorly produced kitsch; analyzing decades of production and sales data, as well as bestseller and best-of lists, Waldfogel finds that the new digital model is just as successful at producing high-quality, successful work as the old industry model, and in many cases more so. The vaunted gatekeeper role of the creative industries proves to have been largely mythical. The high costs of production have stifled creativity in industries that require ever-bigger blockbusters to cover the losses on ever-more-expensive failures.Are we drowning in a tide of cultural silt, or living in a golden age for culture? The answers in Digital Renaissance may surprise you.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39964414-digital-renaissance;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/digital-renaissance-summary/,economics;technology,Author of Digital Renaissance,,,,,

Now he offers his most important book yet, a guide to making big career changesâby choice or necessityâand escaping the horrible feeling of being trapped in the wrong job.Acuff finds it amazing that people spend more than eighteen years studying and preparing for college, but little or no time honing their careers between graduation and retirement.

Dollars and Sense,"Why is paying for things painful?Why are we comfortable overpaying for something in the present just because weâve overpaid for it in the past?Why is it easy to pay $4 for a soda on vacation, when we wouldnât spend more than $1 on that same soda at our local grocery store?We think of money as numbers, values, and amounts, but when it comes down to it, when we actually use our money, we engage our hearts more than our heads. Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In Dollars and Sense, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money. In doing so, they undermine many of personal financeâs most sacred beliefs and explain how we can override some of our own instincts to make better financial choices.Exploring a wide range of everyday topicsâfrom the lure of pain-free spending with credit cards to the Â pitfalls of household budgeting to the seductive power of holiday salesâAriely and Kreisler demonstrate how our misplaced confidence in our spending habits frequently leads us astray, costing us more than we realize, whether itâs the real value of the time we spend driving forty-five minutes to save $10 or our inability to properly assess what the things we buy are actually worth. Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain. Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, Dollars and Sense provides the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8814525-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34323010-dollars-and-sense;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/dollars-and-sense-summary/,psychology;economics;personal-finance,Dan Ariely,,,,,

Traveling to the darkest corners of our dining habits, Foer raises the unspoken question behind every fish we eat, every chicken we fry, and every burger we grill.A must-read for anyone who cares about building a more humane and healthy world, Eating Animals is a book that, in the words of the Los Angeles Times, places Jonathan Safran Foer ""at the table with our greatest philosophers.""",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6462405-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.com/Eating-Animals-Jonathan-Safran-Foer/dp/0316069884?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/eating-animals-summary/,food;philosophy;vegetarianism,Jonathan Safran Foer,,,,,

Ego Is The Enemy,"âWhile the history books are filled with tales of obsessive, visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, Iâve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.â â from the PrologueMany of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.The Ego is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.But why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion?Â  Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, âyou will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work youâve set out to achieve.â",https://sivers.org/images/EgoEnemy.gif,book|https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/ego-is-the-enemy-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/EgoEnemy,psychology,"Author of Trust Me, I’m Lying",,,,,

Emotional Agility,"The counterintuitive approach to achieving your true potential, heralded by the Harvard Business Review as a groundbreaking idea of the year. Â  The path to fulfillment, whether at work or at home, is almost never a straight line. Ask anyone who has achieved their biggest goals or who thrives in their relationships, and youâll hear stories of many unexpected detours along the way. What separates those who rise to these challenges and those who get derailed? The answer is agilityâemotional agility.Emotional agility is a four-step approach that allows us to navigate lifeâs twists and turns with self-acceptance, clear-sightedness, and an open mind. In her more than twenty years of research, Susan David has found that no matter how intelligent, resilient, or creative people are, when they ignore how situations or interactions make them feel, they miss opportunities to gain insight, getting hooked by thoughts, emotions, and habits that prevent them from reaching their full potential. Emotionally agile people experience the same stresses and setbacks as anyone else, but they know how to adapt, aligning their actions with their values and making small changes that lead to a life of growth.Drawing on her extensive professional research, her international consulting work, and her own experiences growing up in Apartheid-era South Africa and losing her father at a young age, David shows how anyone can become more emotionally agile and thrive in an uncertain world. Written with authority, wit, and empathy, Emotional Agility will help you live your most successful life, whoever you are and whatever you face.

Empty Planet,"An award-winning journalist and leading international social researcher make the provocative argument that the global population will soon begin to decline, dramatically reshaping the social, political, and economic landscapeFor half a century, statisticians, pundits, and politicians have warned that a burgeoning planetary population will soon overwhelm the earth's resources. But a growing number of experts are sounding a different kind of alarm. Rather than continuing to increase exponentially, they argue, the global population is headed for a steep decline.Throughout history, depopulation was the product of catastrophe: ice ages, plagues, the collapse of civilizations. This time, however, we're thinning ourselves deliberately, by choosing to have fewer babies than we need to replace ourselves. In much of the developed and developing world, that decline is already underway, as urbanization, women's empowerment, and waning religiosity lead to smaller and smaller families. In Empty Planet, Ibbitson and Bricker travel from South Florida to Sao Paulo, Brussels to Delhi to Beijing, drawing on a wealth of research and firsthand reporting to illustrate the dramatic consequences of this population decline--and to show us why the rest of the developing world will soon join in.They find that a smaller global population will bring with it a number of benefits: fewer workers will command higher wages; the environment will improve; the risk of famine will wane; and falling birthrates in the developing world will bring greater affluence and autonomy for women. But enormous disruption lies ahead, too. We can already see the effects in Europe and parts of Asia, as aging populations and worker shortages weaken the economy and impose crippling demands on healthcare and social security. The United States is well-positioned to sucessfully navigate these coming demographic shifts--that is, unless growing isolationism and anti-immigrant backlash lead us to close ourselves off just as openness becomes more critical to our survival than ever.Rigorously researched and deeply compelling, Empty Planet offers a vision of a future that we can no longer prevent--but one that we can shape, if we choose.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8808816-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.com/Empty-Planet-Global-Population-Decline/dp/1984823213?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/empty-planet-summary/,science;sociology,Darrell Bricker,,,,,
Ending Aging,"MUST WE AGE?A long life in a healthy, vigorous, youthful body has always been one of humanity's greatest dreams. Recent progress in genetic manipulations and calorie-restricted diets in laboratory animals hold forth the promise that someday science will enable us to exert total control over our own biological aging.Nearly all scientists who study the biology of aging agree that we will someday be able to substantially slow down the aging process, extending our productive, youthful lives. Dr. Aubrey de Grey is perhaps the most bullish of all such researchers. As has been reported in media outlets ranging from 60 Minutes to The New York Times, Dr. de Grey believes that the key biomedical technology required to eliminate aging-derived debilitation and death entirely--technology that would not only slow but periodically reverse age-related physiological decay, leaving us biologically young into an indefinite future--is now within reach.In Ending Aging, Dr. de Grey and his research assistant Michael Rae describe the details of this biotechnology. They explain that the aging of the human body, just like the aging of man-made machines, results from an accumulation of various types of damage.Â  As with man-made machines, this damage can periodically be repaired, leading to indefinite extension of the machine's fully functional lifetime, just as is routinely done with classic cars.Â  We already know what types of damage accumulate in the human body, and we are moving rapidly toward the comprehensive development of technologies to remove that damage.Â  By demystifying aging and its postponement for the nonspecialist reader, de Grey and Rae systematically dismantle the fatalist presumption that aging will forever defeat the efforts of medical science.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8122598-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/519781.Ending_Aging;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/ending-aging-summary/,science;health;aging,Aubrey D.

Enlightenment Now,"If you think the world is coming to an end, think again: people are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives, and while our problems are formidable, the solutions lie in the Enlightenment ideal of using reason and science.Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.Far from being a naÃ¯ve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human natureâtribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinkingâwhich demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation.With intellectual depth and literary flair, Enlightenment Now makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8147013-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26434298M/Enlightenment_Now;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/enlightenment-now-summary/,science;sociology,Steven Pinker,,,,,

Everything Is F*cked,"From the author of the international mega-bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck comes a counterintuitive guide to the problems of hope. We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best itâs ever beenâwe are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*ckedâthe planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldnât even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.Whatâs going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, itâs Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didnâtâand worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the âsubtle artâ of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedomâand even of hope itself.With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably havenât considered before. Itâs another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43808723-everything-is-f-cked;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/everything-is-fcked-summary/,psychology;sociology,Mark Manson,,,,,
Excellent Sheep,"A groundbreaking manifesto for people searching for the kind of insight on leading, thinking, and living that elite schools should beâbut arenâtâproviding.As a professor at Yale, Bill Deresiewicz saw something that troubled him deeply. His students, some of the nationâs brightest minds, were adrift when it came to the big questions: how to think critically and creatively, and how to find a sense of purpose.Excellent Sheep takes a sharp look at the high-pressure conveyor belt that begins with parents and counselors who demand perfect grades and culminates in the skewed applications Deresiewicz saw firsthand as a member of Yaleâs admissions committee. As schools shift focus from the humanities to ""practical"" subjects like economics and computer science, students are losing the ability to think in innovative ways. Deresiewicz explains how college should be a time for self-discovery, when students can establish their own values and measures of success, so they can forge their own path. He addresses parents, students, educators, and anyone who's interested in the direction of American society, featuring quotes from real students and graduates he has corresponded with over the years, candidly exposing where the system is broken and clearly presenting solutions.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26886453M/Excellent_sheep;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/excellent-sheep-summary/,education;politics;sociology;philosophy;parenting,William Deresiewicz,,,,,
Executive Presence,"Are you ""leadership material?"" More importantly, do others perceive you to be? Sylvia Ann Hewlett, a noted expert on workplace power and influence, shows you how to identify and embody the Executive Presence (EP) that you need to succeed. You can have the experience and qualifications of a leader, but without executive presence, you won't advance. EP is an amalgam of qualities that true leaders exude, a presence that telegraphs you're in charge or deserve to be. Articulating those qualities isn't easy, however. Based on a nationwide survey of college graduates working across a range of sectors and occupations, Sylvia Hewlett and the Center for Talent Innovation discovered that EP is a dynamic, cohesive mix of appearance, communication, and gravitas. While these elements are not equal, to have true EP, you must know how to use all of them to your advantage. Filled with eye-opening insights, analysis, and practical advice for both men and women, mixed with illustrative examples from executives learning to use the EP, Executive Presence will help you make the leap from working like an executive to feeling like an executive.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/Executive-Presence-Missing-Between-Success/dp/0062246895?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/executive-presence-summary/,business;leadership;management;communication,Sylvia Ann Hewlett,,,,,

Maxwell has the answer: The difference between average people and achieving people is their perception of and response to failure.Most people are never prepared to deal with failure. Maxwell says that if you are like him, coming out of school, you feared it, misunderstood it, and ran away from it. But Maxwell has learned to make failure his friend, and he can teach you to do the same.""I want to help you learn how to confidently look the prospect of failure in the eye and move forward anyway,"" says Maxwell.

  NEW YORK TIMES
 BESTSELLER In this powerful reflection, President Jimmy Carter contemplates how faith has sustained him in happiness and disappointment. He considers how we may find it in our own lives.All his life, President Jimmy Carter has been a courageous exemplar of faith. Now he shares the lessons he learned. He writes, âThe issue of faith arises in almost every area of human existence, so it is important to understand its multiple meanings. In this book, my primary goal is to explore the broader meaning of faith, its far-reaching effect on our lives, and its relationship to past, present, and future events in America and around the world. The religious aspects of faith are also covered, since this is how the word is most often used, and I have included a description of the ways my faith has guided and sustained me, as well as how it has challenged and driven me to seek a closer and better relationship with people and with God.â As President Carter examines faithâs many meanings, he describes how to accept it, live it, how to doubt and find faith again.

Farmageddon,"Farm animals have been disappearing from our fields as the production of food has become a global industry. We no longer know for certain what is entering the food chain and what we are eating â as the UK horsemeat scandal demonstrated. We are reaching a tipping point as the farming revolution threatens our countryside, health and the quality of our food wherever we live in the world.* Our health is under threat: half of all antibiotics used worldwide (rising to 80 per cent in US) are routinely given to industrially farmed animals, contributing to the emergence of deadly antibiotic-resistant superbugs* Wildlife is being systematically destroyed: bees are now trucked across the States (and even airfreighted from Australia) to pollinate the fruit trees in the vast orchards of California, where a chemical assault has decimated the wild insect population* Fresh fish are being hoovered from the oceans: fish that could feed local populations are being turned into fishmeal for farmed fish, chickens and pigs thousands of miles away* Cereals that could feed billions of people are being given to animals: soya and grain that could nourish the worldâs poorest, are now grown increasingly as animal fodder* Epidemic waste underpins the mega-farming model: while food prices rocket, surplus food is thrown away Farmageddon is a fascinating and terrifying investigative journey behind the closed doors of a runaway industry across the world â from the UK, Europe and the USA, to China, Argentina, Peru and Mexico. It is both a wake-up call to change our current food production and eating practices and an attempt to find a way to a better farming future.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/Farmageddon-True-Cost-Cheap-Meat/dp/1408846446?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/farmageddon-summary/,food;environment;science;farming,Author of Farmageddon,,,,,
Fast Food Nation,"To a degree both engrossing and alarming, the story of fast food is the story of postwar Amerca. Though created by a handful of mavericks, the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape, widened the chasm between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad. That's a lengthy list of charges, but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning.Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast food's flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold America's most dangerous job -- meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers' convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations.Along the way, Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains' efforts to reel in the youngest, most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization -- a phenomenon launched by fast food.FAST FOOD NATION is a groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.(jacket)",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8392930-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Dark-All-American/dp/0547750331?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/fast-food-nation-summary/,food;health;sociology,Eric Schlosser,,,,,

Now, after showing you how to reboot your career in his New York Times bestseller Do Over, Acuff shows chronic starters how to actually finish their goals in an age of bottomless distractions and endless opportunities.

If you're going to finish, you have to kill perfectionism. Drawing on his popular 30 Days of Hustle course, Acuff teaches readers to short-circuit perfectionism and make it through to the end of a task.

First Bite,"We are not born knowing what to eat; as omnivores it is something we each have to figure out for ourselves. From childhood onward, we learn how big a âportionâ is and how sweet is too sweet. We learn to enjoy green vegetablesâor not. But how does this education happen? What are the origins of taste?In First Bite, award-winning food writer Bee Wilson draws on the latest research from food psychologists, neuroscientists, and nutritionists to reveal that our food habits are shaped by a whole host of factors: family and culture, memory and gender, hunger and love. Taking the reader on a journey across the globe, Wilson introduces us to people who can only eat foods of a certain color; prisoners of war whose deepest yearning is for Mom's apple pie; a nine year old anosmia sufferer who has no memory of the flavor of her mother's cooking; toddlers who will eat nothing but hotdogs and grilled cheese sandwiches; and researchers and doctors who have pioneered new and effective ways to persuade children to try new vegetables. Wilson examines why the Japanese eat so healthily, whereas the vast majority of teenage boys in Kuwait have a weight problemâand what these facts can tell Americans about how to eat better.The way we learn to eat holds the key to why food has gone so disastrously wrong for so many people. But Wilson also shows that both adults and children have immense potential for learning new, healthy eating habits. An exploration of the extraordinary and surprising origins of our tastes and eating habits, First Bite also shows us how we can change our palates to lead healthier, happier lives.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25159044-first-bite;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/first-bite-summary/,food;parenting,Bee Wilson,,,,,

First Things First,"In the spirit of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, the #1 nationwide bestseller, First Things First is a revolutionary guide to managing your time by learning how to balance your life. Traditional time management suggests that working harder, smarter, and faster will help you gain control over your life, and that increased control will bring peace and fulfillment. The authors of First Things First disagree. In the first real breakthrough in time management in years, Stephen R. Covey, A. Roger Merrill, and Rebecca R. Merrill apply the insights of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to the daily problems of people who must struggle with the ever-increasing demands of work and home life. Rather than focusing on time and things, First Things First emphasizes relationships and results. And instead of efficiency, this new approach emphasizes effectiveness. First Things First shows why we feel a gap between how we spend our time and what's deeply important to us; how focusing on efficiency and control increases the gap instead of closing it; how to determine if what you're doing is really important - or only urgent; why your inner compass is more important than any clock; how to set and achieve principle-centered goals; how to turn your weeks into an upward spiral of learning and living; how to overcome the tremendous gravity of habit; how to turn your resolutions into reality; how to put people ahead of schedules; and how to lead your life, not just manage your time. First Things First offers a principle-centered approach that will transform the quality of everything you do by showing how it involves the need to live, to love, to learn, and to leave a legacy. With the wisdom andinsight that made The 7 Habits of Highly Effective people a #1 bestseller, First Things First empowers readers to define what is truly important; to accomplish worthwhile goals; and to lead rich, rewarding, and balanced lives.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/409160-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/First-Things-Stephen-R-Covey/dp/0671864416?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/first-things-first-summary/,personal-development;productivity,Stephen R.

Forensics: The Anatomy Of Crime,"Val McDermid is one of the finest crime writers we have, whose novels have captivated millions of readers worldwide with their riveting narratives of characters who solve complex crimes and confront unimaginable evil. In the course of researching her bestselling novels McDermid has become familiar with every branch of forensics, and now she uncovers the history of this science, real-world murders and the people who must solve them.The dead talkâto the right listener. They can tell us all about themselves: where they came from, how they lived, how they died, and, of course, who killed them. Forensic scientists can unlock the mysteries of the past and help serve justice using the messages left by a corpse, a crime scene, or the faintest of human traces. Forensics draws on interviews with some of these top-level professionals, ground-breaking research, and McDermidâs own original interviews and firsthand experience on scene with top forensic scientists.Along the way, McDermid discovers how maggots collected from a corpse can help determine oneâs time of death; how a DNA trace a millionth the size of a grain of salt can be used to convict a killer; and how a team of young Argentine scientists led by a maverick American anthropologist were able to uncover the victims of a genocide. Itâs a journey that will take McDermid to war zones, fire scenes, and autopsy suites, and bring her into contact with both extraordinary bravery and wickedness, as she traces the history of forensics from its earliest beginnings to the cutting-edge science of the modern day.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23214337-forensics;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/forensics-the-anatomy-of-crime-summary/,forensics;crime,Val McDermid,,,,,

Game Changers,"The bestselling author of Head Strong and The Bulletproof Diet answers the question ""How do I kick more ass?""âproviding proven techniques for becoming happier, healthier, and smarter, culled from the wisdom and insight of world-class thought leaders and mavericks of science and business.When Dave Asprey started his Bulletproof Radio podcast more than five years ago, he sought out thought leaders and influencers in an array of disciplines, from biochemists to business titans to mediation masters. These folks were some of the top performing humans in the world, people who had changed their areas of study or even pioneered entirely new fields. Dave wanted to know: What did they have in common? What mattered most to them? What makes them so successful at what they doâand what makes them happiest? And so, at the end of each interview, Dave began asking the same question: ""What are your top three recommendations for people who want to kick more ass?""Combing through the recordings, looking for patterns and common threads, he found that the wisdom gleaned from these highly successful people can be distilled into three main categories: body, mind, and spirit. Game Changers is the culmination of Daveâs years-long statistical analysis of these conversations, offering thirty-six science-backed, high performance ""laws"" that are a virtual playbook for how to become not only more successful, but also happier and healthier.Each chapter of Game Changers is structured around one of these laws. Dave combines anecdotes from game changers like Daniel Amen, David Perlmutter, Arianna Huffington, Dan Harris, and Tim Ferris with his own research and practical advice that readers can put into action immediately. From practising gratitude and mindfulness to prioritising social connections and sex, taming fear and anxiety to optimising nutrition and movement, Dave brings together the wisdom of todayâs game-changers to help everyone optimise their lives.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40209370-game-changers;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/game-changers-summary/,personal-development,Author of Game Changers,,,,,

Ghettoside,"On a warm spring evening in South Los Angeles, a young man was shot and killed on a sidewalk minutes away from his home, one of hundreds of young men slain in LA every year. His assailant ran down the street, jumped into an SUV, and vanished, hoping to join the vast majority of killers in American cities who are never arrested for their crimes. But as soon as the case was assigned to Detective John Skaggs, the odds shifted. Here is the kaleidoscopic story of the quintessential American murder--one young black man slaying another--and a determined crew of detectives whose creed was to pursue justice at all costs for its forgotten victims. Ghettoside is a fast-paced narrative of a devastating crime, an intimate portrait of detectives and a community bonded in tragedy, and a surprising new lens into the great subject of murder in America--why it happens and how the plague of killings might yet be stopped.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7333314-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.com/Ghettoside-True-Story-Murder-America/dp/0385529996?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/ghettoside-summary/,crime;sociology,Jill Leovy,,,,,

#GIRLBOSS,"In the New York Times bestseller that the Washington Post called ""Lean In for misfits,"" Sophia Amoruso shares how she went from dumpster diving to founding one of the fastest-growing retailers in the world. Sophia Amoruso spent her teens hitchhiking, committing petty theft, and scrounging in dumpsters for leftover bagels. By age twenty-two she had dropped out of school, and was broke, directionless, and checking IDs in the lobby of an art schoolâ a job sheâd taken for the health insurance. It was in that lobby that Sophia decided to start selling vintage clothes on eBay. Flash forward ten years to today, and sheâs the founder and executive chairman of Nasty Gal, a $250-million-plus fashion retailer with more than four hundred employees. Sophia was never a typical CEO, or a typical anything, and sheâs written #GIRLBOSS for other girls like her: outsiders (and insiders) seeking a unique path to success, even when that path is windy as all hell and lined with naysayers. #GIRLBOSS proves that being successful isnât about where you went to college or how popular you were in high school. Itâs about trusting your instincts and following your gut; knowing which rules to follow and which to break; when to button up and when to let your freak flag fly.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18667945-girlboss;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/girlboss-summary/,business,Author of #GIRLBOSS,,,,,

Grit,"In this instant New York Times bestseller, Angela Duckworth shows anyone striving to succeed that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent, but a special blend of passion and persistence she calls âgrit.â âInspiration for non-geniuses everywhereâ (People).The daughter of a scientist who frequently noted her lack of âgenius,â Angela Duckworth is now a celebrated researcher and professor. It was her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience that led to her hypothesis about what really drives success: not genius, but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance.  In Grit, she takes us into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what sheâs learned from interviewing dozens of high achieversâfrom JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.  âDuckworthâs ideas about the cultivation of tenacity have clearly changed some lives for the betterâ (The New York Times Book Review). Among Gritâs most valuable insights: any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal; grit can be learned, regardless of IQ or circumstances; when it comes to child-rearing, neither a warm embrace nor high standards will work by themselves; how to trigger lifelong interest; the magic of the Hard Thing Rule; and so much more. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how thatânot talent or luckâmakes all the difference. This is âa fascinating tour of the psychological research on successâ (The Wall Street Journal).",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8755928-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/grit-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/Grit,psychology;career,Angela Duckworth,,,,,

Happier At Home,"In the spirit of her blockbuster #1 New York Times bestseller The Happiness Project, Gretchen Rubin embarks on a new project to make home a happier place.Â One Sunday afternoon, as she unloaded the dishwasher, Gretchen Rubin felt hit by a wave of homesickness. Homesickâwhy? She was standing right in her own kitchen. She felt homesick, she realized, with love for home itself. âOf all the elements of a happy life,â she thought, âmy home is the most important.â In a flash, she decided to undertake a new happiness project, and this time, to focus on home.And what did she want from her home? A place that calmed her, and energized her. A place that, by making her feel safe, would free her to take risks. Also, while Rubin wanted to be happier at home, she wanted to appreciate how much happiness was there already.Â So, starting in September (the new January), Rubin dedicated a school yearâSeptember through Mayâto making her home a place of greater simplicity, comfort, and love.Â Â In The Happiness Project, she worked out general theories of happiness. Here she goes deeper on factors that matter for home, such as possessions, marriage, time, and parenthood. How can she control the cubicle in her pocket? How might she spotlight her familyâs treasured possessions? And it really was time to replace that dud toaster.Â Each month, Rubin tackles a different theme as she experiments with concrete, manageable resolutionsâand this time, she coaxes her family to try some resolutions, as well.Â Â With her signature blend of memoir, science, philosophy, and experimentation, Rubinâs passion for her subject jumps off the page, and reading just a few chapters of this book will inspire readers to find more happiness in their own lives.Â Â ",,book|https://www.amazon.com/Happier-Home-Self-Control-Experiments-Everyday/dp/0307886794?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/happier-at-home-summary/,home;happiness,Author of Happier At Home,,,,,
Happiness,"There is a paradox at the heart of our lives. We all want more money, but as societies become richer, they do not become happier. This is not speculation: It's the story told by countless pieces of scientific research. We now have sophisticated ways of measuring how happy people are, and all the evidence shows that on average people have grown no happier in the last fifty years, even as average incomes have more than doubled.  The central question the great economist Richard Layard asks in Happiness is this: If we really wanted to be happier, what would we do differently? First we'd have to see clearly what conditions generate happiness and then bend all our efforts toward producing them. That is what this book is about-the causes of happiness and the means we have to effect it.  Until recently there was too little evidence to give a good answer to this essential question, but, Layard shows us, thanks to the integrated insights of psychology, sociology, applied economics, and other fields, we can now reach some firm conclusions, conclusions that will surprise you. Happiness is an illuminating road map, grounded in hard research, to a better, happier life for us all.  From one of the leading voices in the new field of happiness studies comes a groundbreaking statement of the case: what happiness is, exactly, and how to get more of it, as individuals and as a society",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/872267-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100120.Happiness;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/happiness-summary/,psychology;happiness,Richard Layard,,,,,

A thought-provoking journey into emotion science.â â Wall Street Journal âA singular book, remarkable for the freshness of its ideas and the boldness and clarity with which they are presented.â â Scientific American Â  âA brilliant and original book on the science of emotion, by the deepest thinker about this topic since Darwin.â â Daniel Gilbert, best-selling author of Stumbling on Happiness The science of emotion is in the midst of a revolution on par with the discovery of relativity in physics and natural selection in biology. Leading the charge is psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, whose research overturns the long-standing belief that emotions are automatic, universal, and hardwired in different brain regions. Instead, Barrett shows, we construct each instance of emotion through a uniqueÂ interplay of brain, body, and culture. A lucid report from the cutting edge of emotion science, How Emotions Are Made reveals the profound real-world consequences of this breakthrough for everything from neuroscience and medicine to the legal system and even national security, laying bare the immense implications of our latest and most intimate scientific revolution. âMind-blowing.â â Elle âChock-full of startling, science-backed findings . . .

How Luck Happens,"
  
    New York Times
  
   bestselling author Janice Kaplan examines the phenomenon of luck--and discovers the exciting ways you can grab opportunities and make luck for yourself every day. 
After spending a year researching and experiencing gratitude for The Gratitude Diaries, Janice Kaplan is back to tackle another big, mysterious influence in all our lives: luck. And this time she's joined on her journey by coauthor Dr. Barnaby Marsh, a renowned academic who guides her exploration.Together they uncover the unexpected, little-understood science behind what we call ""luck,"" proving that many seemingly random events are actually under your--and everyone's--control. They examine the factors that made stars like Harrison Ford and Jonathan Groff so successful, and learn the real secrets that made Kate Spade and Warby Parker into global brands. Using original research, fascinating studies, and engaging interviews, Kaplan and Marsh reveal the simple techniques to create luck in love and marriage, business and career, and health, happiness, and family relationships. Their breakthrough insights prove that all of us--from CEOs to stay-at-home moms--can tip the scales of fortune in our favor.Through a mix of scientific research, conversations with famous and successful people--from academics like Dan Ariely and Leonard Mlodinow to actor Josh Groban--and powerful narrative, How Luck Happens uncovers a fascinating subject in accessible and entertaining style.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26947962M/How_luck_happens;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/how-luck-happens-summary/,psychology;personal-development,Janice Kaplan,,,,,

How To Be A Stoic,"In the tradition of How to Live and How Proust Can Change Your Life, a philosopher asks how ancient Stoicism can help us flourish todayWhenever we worry about what to eat, how to love, or simply how to be happy, we are worrying about how to lead a good life. No goal is more elusive. In How to Be a Stoic, philosopher Massimo Pigliucci offers Stoicism, the ancient philosophy that inspired the great emperor Marcus Aurelius, as the best way to attain it. Stoicism is a pragmatic philosophy that focuses our attention on what is possible and gives us perspective on what is unimportant. By understanding Stoicism, we can learn to answer crucial questions: Should we get married or divorced? How should we handle our money in a world nearly destroyed by a financial crisis? How can we survive great personal tragedy? Whoever we are, Stoicism has something for us--and How to Be a Stoic is the essential guide.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Stoic-Ancient-Philosophy/dp/1541644530?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/how-to-be-a-stoic-summary/,philosophy;psychology;stoicism,Author of How To Be A Stoic,,,,,

How We Learn,"In the tradition of The Power of Habit and Thinking, Fast and Slow comes a practical, playful, and endlessly fascinating guide to what we really know about learning and memory todayâand how we can apply it to our own lives.Â  From an early age, it is drilled into our heads: Restlessness, distraction, and ignorance are the enemies of success. Weâre told that learning is all self-discipline, that we must confine ourselves to designated study areas, turn off the music, and maintain a strict ritual if we want to ace that test, memorize that presentation, or nail that piano recital. Â  But what if almost everything we were told about learning is wrong?Â And what if there was a way to achieve more with less effort? Â  In How We Learn, award-winning science reporter Benedict Carey sifts through decades of education research and landmark studies to uncover the truth about how our brains absorb and retain information. What he discovers is that, from the moment we are born, we are all learning quickly, efficiently, and automatically; but in our zeal to systematize the process we have ignored valuable, naturally enjoyable learning tools like forgetting, sleeping, and daydreaming. Is a dedicated desk in a quiet room really the best way to study? Can altering your routine improve your recall? Are there times when distraction is good? Is repetition necessary? Careyâs search for answers to these questions yields a wealth of strategies that make learning more a part of our everyday livesâand less of a chore. Â  By road testing many of the counterintuitive techniques described in this book, Carey shows how we can flex the neural muscles that make deep learning possible. Along the way he reveals why teachers should give final exams on the first day of class, why itâs wise to interleave subjects and concepts when learning any new skill, and when itâs smarter to stay up late prepping for that presentation than to rise early for one last cram session. And if this requires some suspension of disbelief, thatâs because the research defies what weâve been told, throughout our lives, about how best to learn. Â  The brain is not like a muscle, at least not in any straightforward sense. It is something else altogether, sensitive to mood, to timing, to circadian rhythms, as well as to location and environment. It doesnât take orders well, to put it mildly. If the brain is a learning machine, then it is an eccentric one. In How We Learn, Benedict CareyÂ shows us how to exploit its quirks to our advantage. Â Praise for How We LearnâThis book is a revelation. I feel as if Iâve owned a brain for fifty-four years and only now discovered the operating manual.ââMary Roach, bestselling author of Stiff and GulpâA welcome rejoinder to the faddish notion that learning is all about the hours put in.â

Â  âA valuable, entertaining tool for educators, students and parents.â

How We Got To Now,"Did you drink a glass of water today? Did you turn on a light? Did you think about how miraculous either one of those things is when you did it? Of course not--but you should, and New York Times bestselling author Steven Johnson has. This adaptation of his adult book and popular PBS series explores the fascinating and interconnected stories of innovations--like clean drinking water and electricity--that changed the way people live.Innovation starts with a problem whose solution sets in motion all kinds of unexpected discoveries. That's why you can draw a line from pendulums to punching the clock at a factory, from ice blocks to summer movie blockbusters, from clean water to computer chips.In the lively storytelling style that has made him a popular, bestselling author, Steven Johnson looks at how accidental genius, brilliant mistakes, and unintended consequences shape the way we live in the modern world. Johnson's ""long zoom"" approach connects history, geography, politics, and scientific advances with the deep curiousity of inventors or quirky interests of tinkerers to show how innovation truly comes about.His fascinating account is organized into six topics: glass, cold, sound, clean, time, light. Johnson's fresh exploration of these simple, single-syllable word concepts creates an endlessly absorbing story that moves from lightning strikes in the prehistoric desert to the herculean effort to literally raise up the city of Chicago to laser labs straight out of a sci-fi movie.In other words, it's the story of how we got to now!",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38255206-how-we-got-to-now;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/how-we-got-to-now-summary/,innovation;history,Steven Johnson,,,,,

I Wear The Black Hat,"From New York Times bestselling author, âone of Americaâs top cultural criticsâ (Entertainment Weekly), and âThe Ethicistâ for The New York Times Magazine, comes a new book of all original pieces on villains and villainy in popular culture.Chuck Klosterman has walked into the darkness. As a child, he rooted for conventionally good characters like wide-eyed Luke Skywalker in Star Wars. But as Klosterman aged, his alliances shiftedâfirst to Han Solo and then to Darth Vader. Vader was a hero who consciously embraced evil; Vader wanted to be bad. But what, exactly, was that supposed to mean? When we classify someone as a bad person, what are we really saying (and why are we so obsessed with saying it)? In I Wear the Black Hat, Klosterman questions the very nature of how modern people understand the culture of villainy. What was so Machiavellian about Machiavelli? Why donât we see Batman the same way we see Bernhard Goetz? Whoâs more worthy of our vitriolâBill Clinton or Don Henley? What was O.J. Simpsonâs second-worst decision? And why is Klosterman still obsessed with some kid he knew for one week in 1985?Masterfully blending cultural analysis with self-interrogation and limitless imagination, I Wear the Black Hat delivers perceptive observations on the complexity of the anti-hero (seemingly the only kind of hero America still creates). I Wear the Black Hat is the rare example of serious criticism thatâs instantly accessible and really, really funny.

"If You’re So Smart, Why Aren’t You Happy","Could the same traits that drive your career success also be keeping you from being happier?Fifteen years after getting his MBA, Raj Raghunathan spent some time with his old classmates. He noticed that though theyâd all done well, there didnât appear to be much correlation between their academic success and career success. What Raj found even more curious was the even smaller correlation between career success and what he calls life success. The greater the career success, the more unhappy, out of shape, harried and distracted his friends were. Â If intelligence helps with decision-making, smart people should naturally make better life choices. So why are so many of the smartest, brightest, most successful people profoundly unhappy?Â  Raj set out to find an answer to this problem, and extensively researched happiness not just of students and business people, but also stay-at-home-parents, lawyers, and artists, among others. Â If Youâre So Smart, Why Arenât You Happy? takes readers on a fun and meaningful tour of the best research available on how some of the very determinants of success may also come to deflate happiness. Raghunathan explores the seven most common inclinations that successful people need to overcome, and the seven habits they should adopt instead. Among his surprising findings...Â Â·The correlation between wealth and happiness is much smaller than you'd expect it to beÂ·Generosity is not only a key to happiness, but a determining factor of long term successÂ·Appreciating uncertainty, rather than seekingÂ  full control of outcomes, is necessary for happinessÂ If Youâre So Smart, Why Arenât You Happy? will give you a powerful new perspective on your work, personal goals and relationships, whether youâre already successful or just starting out.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27205509M/If_you're_so_smart_why_aren't_you_happy;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-happy-summary/,psychology;career;happiness,Raj Raghunathan,,,,,

Ignore Everybody,"When Hugh MacLeod was a struggling young copywriter living in a YMCA, he started to doodle on the backs of business cards while sitting at a bar. Those cartoons eventually led to a popular blog-gapingvoid.com-and a reputation for pithy insight and humor, in both words and pictures.MacLeod has opinions on everything from marketing to the meaning of life, but one of his main subjects is creativity. How do new ideas emerge in a cynical, risk-averse world? Where does inspiration come from? What does it take to make a living as a creative person?Ignore Everybody expands on MacLeod's sharpest insights, wittiest cartoons, and most useful advice. For example:-Selling out is harder than it looks. Diluting your product to make it more commercial will just make people like it less.-If your plan depends on you suddenly being ""discovered"" by some big shot, your plan will probably fail. Nobody suddenly discovers anything. Things are made slowly and in pain.-Don't try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether. There's no point trying to do the same thing as 250,000 other young hopefuls, waiting for a miracle. All existing business models are wrong. Find a new one.-The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to be yours. The sovereignty you have over your work will inspire far more people than the actual content ever will.After learning MacLeod's forty keys to creativity, you will be ready to unlock your own brilliance and unleash it on the world.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6280787-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23145697M/Ignore_everybody;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/ignore-everybody-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/IgnoreEverybody,career;art,Hugh MacLeod,,,,,
Ikigai - Summary by Derek Sivers,"Bring meaning and joy to all your days with this internationally bestselling guide to the Japanese concept of ikigai (pronounced ee-key-guy)âthe happiness of always being busyâas revealed by the daily habits of the worldâs longest-living people.Whatâs your ikigai?âOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.â âJapanese proverb According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigaiâa reason for living. And according to the residents of the Japanese village with the worldâs longest-living people, finding it is the key to a happier and longer life. Having a strong sense of ikigaiâthe place where passion, mission, vocation, and profession intersectâmeans that each day is infused with meaning. Itâs the reason we get up in the morning. Itâs also the reason many Japanese never really retire (in fact thereâs no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense it does in English): They remain active and work at what they enjoy, because theyâve found a real purpose in lifeâthe happiness of always being busy. In researching this book, the authors interviewed the residents of the Japanese village with the highest percentage of 100-year-oldsâone of the worldâs Blue Zones. Ikigai reveals the secrets to their longevity and happiness: how they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster collaboration and community, andâtheir best-kept secretâhow they find the ikigai that brings satisfaction to their lives. And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own ikigai. Because who doesnât want to find happiness in every day?",https://sivers.org/images/Ikigai.gif,summary|https://sivers.org/book/Ikigai;book|https://www.amazon.in/Ikigai-Japanese-Secret-Long-Happy/dp/0143130722?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/ikigai-summary/,philosophy;career;psychology,Héctor García,,,,,
Immunity,"This significant book conveys Dr. William E. Paulâs enduring enthusiasm for the field of immunology, the incredible accomplishments of the past half-century, and the futureâs untapped promises.The immune system has incredible power to protect us from the ravages of infection by killing disease-causing microbes or eliminating them from the body. Boosted by vaccines, it can protect us individually and as a ""herd"" from diseases such as measles. As Dr. Paul explains, however, the power of the immune system is a double-edged sword: an overactive immune system can wreak havoc, destroying normal tissue and causing diseases such as type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. The consequences of an impaired immune system, on the other hand, are all too evident in the clinical agonies of AIDS and other immunodeficiency diseases.Packed with illustrations, stories from Dr. Paulâs distinguished career, and compelling narratives of scientific discovery, Immunity presents the three laws of the human immune systemâuniversality, tolerance, and appropriatenessâand explains how the system protects and harms us. From the tale of how smallpox was overcome to the lessons of the Ebola epidemic to the utility of vaccines and the hope that the immune system can be used to treat or prevent cancer, Dr. Paul argues that we must position ourselves to take advantage of cutting-edge technologies and promising new tools in immunological research, including big data and the microbiome.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27208556M/Immunity;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/immunity-summary/,immunology;health,William E.

Imperfect Courage,"Want to make a move but scared to leave your comfort zone? Go anyway.""Jessica's perspective of global sisterhood and the power of lifting each other up in the midst of fear and scarcity is exactly what we need today. This book is both an invitation and a challenge to bravely show up for ourselves, for the people we love, and for the strangers that we will one day call family. I say, Amen!"" --Brenï¿½ Brown, Ph.D., Author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Braving the WildernessIn Imperfect Courage, the founder of the popular fair trade jewelry brand Noonday Collection shares her story of starting the rapid-growing business that impacts over 4,500 artisans in vulnerable communities across the globe--and invites readers on a journey of transformation, challenging them to trade their comfort zones for a life of impact and adventure.
  
In 2015, Inc. magazine recognized Noonday Collection as one of the fastest-growing companies in America. But years earlier, as Jessica Honegger stood at a pawn-shop counter in Austin, Texas, and handed over her grandmother's gold jewelry, her goal was much more personal: to fund the adoption of her Rwandan son, Jack, by selling artisan-made jewelry.This first step launched an unexpected side-hustle that would grow into Noonday Collection. Jessica embarked on this new journey and teamed up with her first artisan partner, Jalia, a Ugandan jewelry maker. She saw the meaningful impact Noonday brought to Jalia's community and knew it was the right move.Fear crept into Jessica's heart as she realized her success, or failure, meant the same for Jalia. But refusing to let fear hinder her goals, Jessica found the necessary (if imperfect) courage she needed along the way--the courage to leave comfort and embrace a life of risk and impact.Discover Your Imperfect Courage In Imperfect Courage, Jessica takes you by the hand and invites you to trade your comfort zone for a life of impact and meaning. - First, she invites you to draw a circle of compassion around yourself and leads you through some soul-searching aimed at setting you free from shame.  - Next, she challenges all of us to come together, dare to be vulnerable with one another, and commit to building a culture of collaboration.  - Finally, Jessica calls on you to broaden your circle of compassion to embrace the entire globe--and to bring your beautifully imperfect courage to a world that needs you.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37003176-imperfect-courage;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/imperfect-courage-summary/,personal-development,Jessica Honegger,,,,,

Inner Engineering,"New York Times Bestseller: Thought leader, visionary, philanthropist, mystic, and yogi Sadhguru presents Western readers with a time-tested path to achieving absolute well-being: the classical science of yoga.The practice of hatha yoga, as we commonly know it, is but one of eight branches of the body of knowledge that is yoga. In fact, yoga is a sophisticated system of self-empowerment that is capable of harnessing and activating inner energies in such a way that your body and mind function at their optimal capacity. It is a means to create inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the architect of your own joy.A yogi lives life in this expansive state, and in this transformative book Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening, from a boy with an unusual affinity for the natural world to a young daredevil who crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, where time stood still and he emerged radically changed. Today, as the founder of Isha, an organization devoted to humanitarian causes, he lights the path for millions. The term guru, he notes, means âdispeller of darkness, someone who opens the door for you. . . . As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation means that nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you perceive and experience life.â The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging book offers readers time-tested tools that are fresh, alive, and radiantly new. Inner Engineering presents a revolutionary way of thinking about our agency and our humanity and the opportunity to achieve nothing less than a life of joy.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27220077M/Inner_engineering;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/inner-engineering-summary/,yoga;psychology,"Vasudev, Jaggi Sadhguru",,,,,

Invisible Influence,"Jonah Berger, the bestselling author of Contagious, explores the subtle, secret influences that affect the decisions we make from what we buy, to the careers we choose, to what we eat in his latest New York Times bestseller that is a rare business book that s both informative and enough fun to take to the beach (Fortune.com). If you re like most people, you think your individual tastes and opinions drive your choices and behaviors. You wear a certain jacket because you liked how it looked. You picked a particular career because you found it interesting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions is patently obvious. Right? Wrong. Without our realizing it, other people s behavior has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane to the momentous. Even strangers have an impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes toward a welfare policy shift if we re told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans (even though the policy is the same). But social influence doesn t just lead us to do the same things as others. In some cases we imitate others around us. But in other cases we avoid particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream. We skip buying the minivan because we don t want to look like a soccer mom. By understanding how social influence works, we can decide when to resist and when to embrace it and learn how we can use this knowledge to exercise more control over our own behavior. In Invisible Influence, Jonah Berger is consistently entertaining, applying science to real life in surprising ways and explaining research through narrative. His book fascinates because it opens up the moving parts of a mysterious machine, allowing readers to watch them in action (Publishers Weekly).""",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8869123-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27407178M/Invisible_Influence;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/invisible-influence-summary/,psychology,Jonah Berger,,,,,

Leaders Eat Last,"The New York TimesÂ bestselling follow-up to Simon Sinek's global hitÂ Start With WhyWhy do only a few peopleÂ get to say âI love my jobâ?Â It seems unfair that finding fulfillment atÂ work is like winning a lottery; that only aÂ few lucky ones get to feel valued by theirÂ organizations, to feel like they belong.Imagine a world where almost everyone wakesÂ up inspired to go to work, feels trusted and valuedÂ during the day, then returns home feeling fulfilled.This is not a crazy, idealized notion. Today, inÂ many successful organizations, great leaders areÂ creating environments in which people naturallyÂ work together to do remarkable things.Â In his travels around the world since the publicationÂ of his bestsellerÂ Start with Why, Simon SinekÂ noticed that some teams were able to trust each otherÂ so deeply that they would literally put their lives onÂ the line for each other. Other teams, no matter whatÂ incentives were offered, were doomed to infighting,Â fragmentation and failure. Why?The answer became clear during a conversationÂ with a Marine Corps general.Â âOfficers eat last,â he said.Sinek watched as the most junior Marines ateÂ first while the most senior Marines took their placeÂ at the back of the line. Whatâs symbolic in the chowÂ hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: great leadersÂ sacrifice their own comfortâeven their own survivalâfor the good of those in their care.This principle has been true since the earliestÂ tribes of hunters and gatherers. Itâs not a managementÂ theory; itâs biology. Our brains and bodies evolvedÂ to help us find food, shelter, mates and especiallyÂ safety. Weâve always lived in a dangerous world,Â facing predators and enemies at every turn. WeÂ thrived only when we felt safe among our group.Our biology hasnât changed in fifty thousandÂ years, but our environment certainly has. TodayâsÂ workplaces tend to be full of cynicism, paranoiaÂ and self-interest. But the best organizations fosterÂ trust and cooperation because their leaders buildÂ what Sinek calls a Circle of Safety that separates theÂ security inside the team from the challenges outside.The Circle of Safety leads to stable, adaptive,Â confident teams, where everyone feels they belongÂ and all energies are devoted to facing the commonÂ enemy and seizing big opportunities.Â As he did inÂ Start with Why, Sinek illustratesÂ his ideas with fascinating true stories from a wideÂ range of examples, from the military to manufacturing,Â from government to investment banking.The biology is clear: when it matters most, leadersÂ who are willing to eat last are rewarded withÂ deeply loyal colleagues who will stop at nothing to advance their leaderâs vision and their organizationâsÂ interests. Itâs amazing how well it works.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8142524-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1543614620?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/leaders-eat-last-summary/,leadership,Simon Sinek,,,,,
Lean In,"Sheryl Sandbergâs Lean In is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women. The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of Time magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in. The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour â of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg â Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business â draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7254305-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16071764-lean-in;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/lean-in-summary/,business;feminism;career,Sheryl Sandberg,,,,,

Topics include energy, debt, consumerism, agriculture and our skewed perceptions of time.  """"In today's world we are grappling at every turn with an increasing energy shortage, food production systems that struggle to feed increasing millions, environmental problems that threaten our survival, a debt crisis that is crippling individuals and governments, and so much more.

Long Walk To Freedom,"Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's anti-apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. The foster son of a Thembu chief, Mandela was raised in the traditional, tribal culture of his ancestors, but at an early age learned the modern, inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid, one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived. In classically elegant and engrossing prose, he tells of his early years as an impoverished student and law clerk in a Jewish firm in Johannesburg, of his slow political awakening, and of his pivotal role in the rebirth of a stagnant ANC and the formation of its Youth League in the 1950s. He describes the struggle to reconcile his political activity with his devotion to his family, the anguished breakup of his first marriage, and the painful separations from his children.

Losing My Virginity,"""Oh, screw it, let's do it.""That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard Branson, in slightly more than twenty-five years, to spawn so many successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none. ""Losing My Virginity"" is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that ""since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin."" Since then, Branson has written his own ""rules"" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.Many of Richard Branson's companies -- airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples -- were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, ""Don't do it."" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. ""Losing My Virginity"" is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:  Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined tohave another go at being the first to circle the globeSigning the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil CollinsFighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishmentSwimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of MexicoSelling Virgin Records to save Virgin AtlanticStaging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .And much more. ""Losing My Virginity"" is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6620629-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Losing-My-Virginity-Survived-Business/dp/0812931017?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/losing-my-virginity-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/RichardBranson,business;richard-branson,Richard Branson,,,,,
Lost Connections,"From the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs, a startling challenge to our thinking about depression and anxiety.Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking antidepressants when he was a teenager. He was toldâlike his entire generationâthat his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate this questionâand he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong. Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causesâand they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today. Hariâs journey took him from the people living in the tunnels beneath Las Vegas, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlinâall showing in vivid and dramatic detail these new insights. They lead to solutions radically different from the ones we have been offered up until now.Just as Chasing the Scream transformed the global debate about addiction, with over twenty million views for his TED talk and the animation based on it, Lost Connections will lead us to a very different debate about depression and anxietyâone that shows how, together, we can end this epidemic.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/lost-connections-summary/,psychology;depression;mental-health;anxiety,Johann Hari,,,,,
Loving What Is,"Out of nowhere, like a breeze in a marketplace crowded with advice, comes Byron Katie and âThe Work.â In the midst of a normal life, Katie became increasingly depressed, and over a ten-year period sank further into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you can discover the same freedom through The Work. The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, âItâs not the problem that causes our suffering; itâs our thinking about the problem.â Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point, we can truly love what is, just as it is.Loving What Is will show you step-by-step, through clear and vivid examples, exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. Youâll see people do The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave her husband because he wants more sex, to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of terrorism, to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered The Workâs power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even in situations that had previously seemed impossible. If you continue to do The Work, you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing peace. Loving What Is offers everything you need to learn and live this remarkable process, and to find happiness as what Katie calls âa lover of reality.â",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL22990522M/Loving_what_is;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/loving-what-is-summary/,psychology,Byron Katie,,,,,

Make Time,"Nobody ever looked at an empty calendar and said, 'The best way to spend this time is by cramming it full of meetings!' Or got to work in the morning and thought, 'Today I'll spend hours on Facebook!' Yet, that's exactly what we do. Why?In a world where information refreshes endlessly and the workday feels like a race to react to other people's priorities faster, frazzled and distracted has become our default position. But what if the exhaustion of constant busyness wasnât mandatory? What if you could step off the hamster wheel and start taking control of your time and attention? Thatâs what this book is about.As creators of Google Ventures' renowned 'design sprint', Jake and John have helped hundreds of teams solve important problems by changing how they work. Building on the success of these sprints and their experience designing ubiquitous tech products like Gmail and YouTube, they spent years experimenting with their own personal habits and routines, looking for ways to help individuals optimize their energy, focus, and time. Now they've packaged the most effective tactics into a four-step daily framework that anyone can use to systematically design their days.Make Time is not a one-size-fits-all formula. Instead, it offers a customizable menu of bite-sized tips and strategies that can be tailored to individual habits and lifestyles. It isnât about productivity, or checking off more to-dos. Nor does it propose unrealistic solutions like throwing out your smartphone or swearing off social media. Making time isnât about radically overhauling your lifestyle; itâs about making small shifts in your environment to liberate yourself from constant busyness and distraction.A must-read for anyone who has ever thought 'If only there were more hours in the day...' Make Time will help you to stop passively reacting to the demands of the modern world and start intentionally making time for the things that matter.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/make-time-summary/,productivity,Author of Make Time,,,,,

Making Ideas Happen," How the world's leading innovators push their ideas to fruition again and again   Edison famously said that genius is 1 percent inspiration, 99 percent perspiration. Ideas for new businesses, solutions to the world's problems, and artistic breakthroughs are common, but great execution is rare.  According to Scott Belsky, the capacity to make ideas happen can be developed by anyone willing to develop their organizational habits and leadership capability. That's why he founded Behance, a company that helps creative people and teams across industries develop these skills.  Belsky has spent six years studying the habits of creative people and teams that are especially productive-the ones who make their ideas happen time and time again. After interviewing hundreds of successful creatives, he has compiled their most powerful-and often counterintuitive-practices, such as: â¢Generate ideas in moderation and kill ideas liberally  â¢Prioritize through nagging  â¢Encourage fighting within your team  While many of us obsess about discovering great new ideas, Belsky shows why it's better to develop the capacity to make ideas happen-a capacity that endures over time.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6387329-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24226214M/Making_Ideas_Happen;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/making-ideas-happen-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/MakingIdeasHappen,design;innovation;productivity,Scott Belsky,,,,,

Mindsight - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"From a pioneer in the field of mental health comes a groundbreaking book on the healing power of ""mindsight,"" the potent skill that is the basis for both emotional and social intelligence. Mindsight allows you to make positive changes in your brain-and in your life.- Is there a memory that torments you, or an irrational fear you can' t shake?- Do you sometimes become unreasonably angry or upset and find it hard to calm down?- Do you ever wonder why you can't stop behaving the way you do, no matter how hard you try?- Are you and your child (or parent, partner, or boss) locked in a seemingly inevitable pattern of conflict?What if you could escape traps like these and live a fuller, richer, happier life? This isn't mere speculation but the result of twenty-five years of careful hands-on clinical work by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D. A Harvard-trained physician, Dr. Siegel is one of the revolutionary global innovators in the integration of brain science into the practice of psychotherapy. Using case histories from his practice, he shows how, by following the proper steps, nearly everyone can learn how to focus their attention on the internal world of the mind in a way that will literally change the wiring and architecture of their brain.Through his synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have helped hundreds of patients heal themselves from painful events in the past and liberate themselves from obstacles blocking their happiness in the present. And now he has written the first book that will help all of us understand the potential we have to create our own lives. Showing us mindsight in action, Dr. Siegel describes- a sixteen-year-old boy with bipolar disorder who uses meditation and other techniques instead of drugs to calm the emotional storms that made him suicidal- a woman paralyzed by anxiety, who uses mindsight to discover, in an unconscious memory of a childhood accident, the source of her dread- a physician-the author himself-who pays attention to his intuition, which he experiences as a ""vague, uneasy feeling in my belly, a gnawing restlessness in my heart and my gut,"" and tracks down a patient who could have gone deaf because of an inaccurately written prescription for an ear infection- a twelve-year-old girl with OCD who learns a meditation that is ""like watching myself from outside myself"" and, using a form of internal dialogue, is able to stop the compulsive behaviors that have been tormenting herThese and many other extraordinary stories illustrate how mindsight can help us master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest potential.A book as inspiring as it is informative, as practical as it is profound, Mindsight offers exciting new proof that we aren't hardwired to behave in certain ways, but instead have the ability to harness the power of our minds to resculpt the neural pathways of our brains in ways that will be life-transforming.",,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/mindsight-summary/;book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6315775-mindsight,psychology;mental-health,Daniel J.

Mini Habits,"I had experimented with personal development strategies for a decade. When I accidentally started my first mini habitâand the changes I made were actually lastingâI realized the prior strategies I relied on were complete failures. When something works, that which doesn't work is exposed. The science in Mini Habits exposes the predictably inconsistent results of most popular personal growth strategies, and reveals why mini habits are consistent.  A mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; a mini habit's ""too small to fail"" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy.  Mini Habits will better equip you to change your life than 99% of the people you see walking around on this globe. People so often think that they are the reason they can't achieve lasting change; but the problem isn't with themâit's with their strategy. You can achieve great things without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies such as ""getting motivated,"" resolutions, or even ""just doing it.â To make changes last, you need to stop fighting against your brain. When you start playing by your brain's rulesâas mini habits show you how to doâlasting change isn't so hard.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8093714-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20567918-mini-habits;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/mini-habits-summary/,habits;productivity,Stephen Guise,,,,,

Includes a foreword by bestselling author and FranklinCovey executive Sean Covey.Teamwork is crucial to the success of any business, and as acclaimed author and speaker Ron Clark illustrates, the members of any team are the key to unlocking success. Imagine a company as a bus filled with people who either help or hinder a team's ability to move it forward: drivers (who steer the organization), runners (who consistently go above and beyond for the good of the organization), joggers (who do their jobs without pushing themselves), walkers (who are just getting pulled along), and riders (who hinder success and drag the team down). It's the team leader's job to recognize how members fall into these categories, encourage them to keep the ""bus"" moving by working together, and know when it's time to kick the riders off.In the tradition of Who Moved My Cheese? and Fish!, Move Your Bus is an accessible and uplifting business parable that illustrates Clark's expert strategies to maximize the performance of each member of a team.

Option B,"From Facebook's COO and Wharton's top-rated professor, the #1 New York Times best-selling authors of Lean In and Originals:  a powerful, inspiring, and practical book about building resilience and moving forward after life's inevitable setbacks.After the sudden death of her husband, Sheryl Sandberg felt certain that she and her children would never feel pure joy again. ""I was in 'the void, '"" she writes, ""a vast emptiness that fills your heart and lungs and restricts your ability to think or even breathe."" Her friend Adam Grant, a psychologist at Wharton, told her there are concrete steps people can take to recover and rebound from life-shattering experiences. We are not born with a fixed amount of resilience. It is a muscle that everyone can build.  Option B combines Sheryl's personal insights with Adam's eye-opening research on finding strength in the face of adversity. Beginning with the gut-wrenching moment when she finds her husband, Dave Goldberg, collapsed on a gym floor, Sheryl opens up her heart--and her journal--to describe the acute grief and isolation she felt in the wake of his death. But Option B goes beyond Sheryl's loss to explore how a broad range of people have overcome hardships including illness, job loss, sexual assault, natural disasters, and the violence of war. Their stories reveal the capacity of the human spirit to persevere . . . and to rediscover joy. Resilience comes from deep within us and from support outside us. Even after the most devastating events, it is possible to grow by finding deeper meaning and gaining greater appreciation in our lives. Option B illuminates how to help others in crisis, develop compassion for ourselves, raise strong children, and create resilient families, communities, and workplaces. Many of these lessons can be applied to everyday struggles, allowing us to brave whatever lies ahead. Two weeks after losing her husband, Sheryl was preparing for a father-child activity. ""I want Dave,"" she cried. Her friend replied, ""Option A is not available,"" and then promised to help her make the most of Option B. We all live some form of Option B. This book will help us all make the most of it.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8054737-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.com/Option-Adversity-Building-Resilience-Finding/dp/1524732680?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/option-b-summary/,personal-development,Sheryl Sandberg,,,,,
Orientalism,"More than three decades after its first publication, Edward Said's groundbreaking critique of the West's historical, cultural, and political perceptions of the East has become a modern classic.In this wide-ranging, intellectually vigorous study, Said traces the origins of ""orientalism"" to the centuries-long period during which Europe dominated the Middle and Near East and, from its position of power, defined ""the orient"" simply as ""other than"" the occident. This entrenched view continues to dominate western ideas and, because it does not allow the East to represent itself, prevents true understanding.

Out Of Our Minds,"Creativity is critical.Out of Our Minds explores creativity: its value in business, its ubiquity in children, its perceived absence in many adults and the phenomenon through which it disappears -- and offers a groundbreaking approach for getting it back. Author Sir Ken Robinson is an internationally recognised authority on creativity, and his TED talk on the subject is the most watched video in TED's history. In this book, Sir Ken argues that organisations everywhere are struggling to fix a problem that originates in schools and universities. Organisations everywhere are competing in a world that changes in the blink of an eye - they need people who are flexible enough to adapt, and creative enough to find novel solutions to problems old and new. Out of Our Minds describes how schools, businesses and communities can work together to bring creativity out of the closet and realise its inherent value at every stage of life. This new third edition has been updated to reflect changing technologies and demographics, with updated case studies and coverage of recent changes to education.While education and training are the keys to the future, the key can also be turned the other way; locking people away from their own creativity. Only by actively fostering creativity can businesses unlock those doors and achieve their true potential. This book will help you to:Understand the importance of actively promoting creativity and innovation. Discover why creativity stagnates somewhere between childhood and adulthood. Learn how to re-awaken dormant creativity to help your business achieve more. Explore ways in which we can work together to keep creativity alive for everyone. Modern business absolutely demands creativity of thought and action. We're all creative as children -- so where does it go? When do we lose it?

Outwitting The Devil,"In 1938, just after publication of his all-time best-seller Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill reveals that he broke the Devil's Code, forcing him to confess his secrets. The resulting manuscript ? Outwitting the Devil ? proved so controversial, it was hidden for more than seventy years. Now Sharon Lechter brings us this important book, annotating and editing it for a contemporary audience. Using his legendary ability to get to the root of human potential, Hill digs deep to identify the greatest obstacles we face in reaching our personal goals ? including fear, procrastination, anger, and jealousy ? as tools orchestrated by the Devil himself. These hidden methods of control can lead us to ruin, and Hill reveals the seven principles of good that will allow us to finally triumph over them and succeed. Fascinating, provocative, and empowering, Outwitting the Devil shows how to create your own path to success, harmony, and fulfillment in an age of uncertainty and fear. My simple faith is this: If we are created in God's image, then we were born to create, and to create is to prosper. [This] previously unpublished Napoleon Hill manuscript...

Oxygen,"Three hundred million years ago, dragonflies grew as big as seagulls, with wingspans nearly a yard across. Researchers claim they could have flown only if the air had contained more oxygen than today-probably as much as 35 per cent. But oxygen is a toxic gas. Fruit flies raised at twice the normal level of oxygen live half as long as their siblings. If atmospheric oxygen reached 35 per cent in the Carboniferous, why did oxygen promote exuberant growth, instead of rapid aging and death? This is just one of the puzzles Nick Lane answers in Oxygen. Lane takes the reader on an enthralling journey, as gripping as a thriller, as he unravels the unexpected ways in which oxygen spurred the evolution of life and death. The book explains far more than the size of ancient insects: it shows how oxygen underpins the origin of biological complexity, the birth of photosynthesis, the sudden evolution of animals, the need for two sexes, the accelerated aging of cloned animals like Dolly the sheep, and the surprisingly long lives of bats and birds. Drawing on this grand evolutionary canvas, Oxygen offers fresh perspectives on our own lives and deaths, explaining modern killer diseases, why we age, and what we can do about it.  Advancing revelatory new ideas, following chains of evidence, the book ranges through many disciplines, from environmental sciences to molecular medicine. The result is a captivating vision of contemporary science and a humane synthesis of our place in nature. This remarkable book will redefine the way we think about the world.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/130854-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Oxygen-Molecule-that-Made-World/dp/0198508034?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/oxygen-summary/,science;chemistry;biology,Nick Lane,,,,,
Payoff,"Bestselling author Dan Ariely reveals fascinating new insights into motivation--showing that the subject is far more complex than we ever imagined. Every day we work hard to motivate ourselves, the people we live with, the people who work for and do business with us. In this way, much of what we do can be defined as being ""motivators."" From the boardroom to the living room, our role as motivators is complex, and the more we try to motivate partners and children, friends and coworkers, the clearer it becomes that the story of motivation is far more intricate and fascinating than we've assumed. Payoff investigates the true nature of motivation, our partial blindness to the way it works, and how we can bridge this gap. With studies that range from Intel to a kindergarten classroom, Ariely digs deep to find the root of motivation--how it works and how we can use this knowledge to approach important choices in our own lives. Along the way, he explores intriguing questions such as: Can giving employees bonuses harm productivity? Why is trust so crucial for successful motivation? What are our misconceptions about how to value our work? How does your sense of your mortality impact your motivation?",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27225874M/Payoff;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/payoff-summary/,psychology;motivation,Dan Ariely,,,,,

Whether someone is trying to qualify for the Olympics, break ground in mathematical theory or craft an artistic masterpiece, many of the practices that lead to great success are the same. In Peak Performance, Brad Stulberg, a former McKinsey and Company consultant and journalist who covers health and the science of human performance, and Steve Magness, a performance scientist and coach of Olympic athletes, team up to demystify these practices and demonstrate how everyone can achieve their best.The first book of its kind, Peak Performance combines the inspiring stories of top performers across a range of capabilities - from athletic, to intellectual, to artistic - with the latest scientific insights into the cognitive and neurochemical factors that drive performance in all domains.

Pre-Suasion,"The author of the legendary bestseller Influence, social psychologist Robert Cialdini shines a light on effective persuasion and reveals that the secret doesnât lie in the message itself, but in the key moment before that message is delivered.What separates effective communicators from truly successful persuaders? Using the same combination of rigorous scientific research and accessibility that made his Influence an iconic bestseller, Robert Cialdini explains how to capitalize on the essential window of time before you deliver an important message. This âprivileged moment for changeâ prepares people to be receptive to a message before they experience it. Optimal persuasion is achieved only through optimal pre-suasion. In other words, to change âmindsâ a pre-suader must also change âstates of mind.âHis first solo work in over thirty years, Cialdiniâs Pre-Suasion draws on his extensive experience as the most cited social psychologist of our time and explains the techniques a person should implement to become a master persuader. Altering a listenerâs attitudes, beliefs, or experiences isnât necessary, says Cialdiniâall thatâs required is for a communicator to redirect the audienceâs focus of attention before a relevant action.From studies on advertising imagery to treating opiate addiction, from the annual letters of Berkshire Hathaway to the annals of history, Cialdini draws on an array of studies and narratives to outline the specific techniques you can use on online marketing campaigns and even effective wartime propaganda. He illustrates how the artful diversion of attention leads to successful pre-suasion and gets your targeted audience primed and ready to say, âYes.â",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7880005-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29238799-pre-suasion;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/pre-suasion-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/PreSuasion,psychology;communication,Robert B.

Predictable Success,"Predictable Success Reveal as a startlingly simple, intuitive, and universal process that will bring sustained, lasting, and measurable success to any organization. About the Book: Predictable Success No matter what kind of organization you work for, whether it's your own small business or a global Fortune 100 company, your number-one goal is success. Predictable Success takes you step-by-step through a startlingly simple, intuitive, and universal process that shows you how to bring sustained, lasting, predictable success to your organization. Find out where your organization is today and take the uncertainty out of tomorrow as you make the journey towards Predictable Success. In the book is essentially an infomercial for his own company, the author addresses groups of people who have common goals and guides them in the achievement of their united goals-and, just as important, instructs them in sustaining success once it has been achieved. The author acknowledges the elusiveness of success in business, and to that end, he bases his ideas on the premise that it is fundamentally untrue-but almost universally believed-that success will just happen if we land on the right procedures. Guessing what those procedures are, or trying different ones on a Russian-roulette kind of basis, is simply wrong; what is right is to abide by the code McKeown prescribes. While most business books either focus on successful corporate barons and how they ventured to the top or detail the minutiae of getting a business model right for entrepreneurs to 'start-up' with promise, there is little documentation with regard to understanding the evolution (and mutation) patterns of a business and sustaining growth and balance to become and (more importantly) remain successful. In this context, Predictable Success belongs to a 'white space' in business writing by outlining the principal processes and challenges firms need to tackle during different phases in a growth cycle.

Problem Solving 101,"The fun and simple problem-solving guide that took Japan by stormKen Watanabe originally wrote Problem Solving 101 for Japanese schoolchildren. His goal was to help shift the focus in Japanese education from memorization to critical thinking, by adapting some of the techniques he had learned as an elite McKinsey consultant.He was amazed to discover that adults were hungry for his fun and easy guide to problem solving and decision making. The book became a surprise Japanese bestseller, with more than 370,000 in print after six months. Now American businesspeople can also use it to master some powerful skills.Watanabe uses sample scenarios to illustrate his techniques, which include logic trees and matrixes. A rock band figures out how to drive up concert attendance. An aspiring animator budgets for a new computer purchase. Students decide which high school they will attend.Illustrated with diagrams and quirky drawings, the book is simple enough for a middleschooler to understand but sophisticated enough for business leaders to apply to their most challenging problems.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8122635-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL22569284M/Problem_solving_101;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/problem-solving-101-summary/,thinking;problem-solving,Ken Watanabe,,,,,

Psyched Up,"Harvard Business Review editor Daniel McGinn explains science of how the difference between success and failure at life's big moments can come down to what you do in the last few minutes before you start. The science of effective practice and how to perform at peak levels has long been a popular subject of research. But more recently, scientists have uncovered the underappreciated but important bridge between the two--mental preparation. Chances are, you aren't mentally preparing effectively, even though you can truly get better results at life's high-pressure moments with science-backed practices. Psyched is a book about what we can do before you have to perform. It examines new ways to deal with the flood of adrenaline, increase focus, and otherwise optimize our emotions before we take the stage. McGinn investigates: .how trying to calm down backfires.what to put into your pre-performance music mix.what kinds of pep talks work best..And why he wrote it on Malcolm Gladwell's old keyboard He also introduces readers to high-performing professionals who are putting these techniques to work--superstars like General Stanley McChrystal, Nascar champion driver Jimmie Johnson, Boston College football coach Steve Addazio, legendary tennis coach Nick Bollettieri, T-Mobile CEO John Legere, and others who, despite years of practice and enviable track records, will ultimately be judged on their ability to deliver a single solid performance when it counts. As the nature of work has changed, many professionals now succeed or fail based less on repetitive daily tasks, and more on a thin slice of evaluative moments. If you work 2,000 hours a year but your overall success rests mostly on your performance during a few dozen crucial hours, the tools in this book should help you pull off your best performances when it counts the most.""",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8850422-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Psyched-Up-Science-Preparation-Succeed/dp/159184830X?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/psyched-up-summary/,psychology;personal-development,Daniel McGinn,,,,,

Purple Cow - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"The acclaimed Wall Street Journal and Business Week Bestseller.You're either a Purple Cow or you're not. You're either remarkable or invisible. Make your choice. What do Starbucks and JetBlue and KrispyKreme and Apple and DutchBoy and Kensington and Zespri and Hard Candy have that you don't? How do they continue to confound critics and achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and true brands to gasp their last? Face it, the checklist of tired 'P's marketers have used for decades to get their product noticed - Pricing, Promotion, Publicity, to name a few - aren't working anymore. There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow. Cows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows - but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period. In Purple Cow, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place.

QBQ!,"The lack of personal accountability is a problem that has resulted in an epidemic of blame, victim thinking, complaining, and procrastination. No organizationâor individualâcan successfully compete in the marketplace, achieve goals and objectives, provide outstanding service, engage in exceptional teamwork, or develop people without personal accountability.Â Â  John G. Miller believes that the troubles that plague organizations cannot be solved by pointing fingers and blaming others. Rather, the real solutions are found when each of us recognizes the power of personal accountability. In QBQ! The Question Behind the QuestionÂ®, Miller explains how negative, ill-focused questions like âWhy do we have to go through all this change?â and âWho dropped the ball?â represent a lack of personal accountability. Conversely, when we ask better questionsâQBQsâsuch as âWhat can I do to contribute?â or âHow can I help solve the problem?â our lives and our organizations are transformed.THE QBQ! PROMISEThis remarkable and timely book provides a practical method for putting personal accountability into daily actions, with astonishing results: problems are solved, internal barriers come down, service improves, teams thrive, and people adapt to change more quickly. QBQ! is an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to learn, grow, and change. Using this tool, each of us can add tremendous worth to our organizations and to our lives by eliminating blame, victim-thinking, and procrastination.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â QBQ! was written more than a decade ago and has helped countless readers practice personal accountability at work and at home.

Quiet,"At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introvertsâRosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniakâthat we owe many of the great contributions to society.In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7079753-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25184609M/Quiet;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/quiet-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/Quiet,psychology;introversion,Susan Cain,,,,,
Quitter,"Have you ever felt caught between the tension of a day job and a dream job? That gap between what you have to do and what you'd love to do?I have. At first I thought I was the only one who felt that way, but then I started to talk to people and realized we're becoming the ""I'm, but"" generation. When we talk about what we do for a living we inevitably say, ""I'm a teacher, but I want to be an artist."" ""I'm a CPA, but I'd love to start my own business."" ""I'm a _____, but I want to be a ______."" All too often, we hear that dreaming big means you quit your day job, sell everything you own, and move to Guam. But what if there were a different way? What if you could blow up your dream without blowing up your life? What if you could go for broke without going broke? What if you could start today? What if you already have everything you need to begin? From figuring out what your dream is to quitting in a way that exponentially increases your chance of success, Quitter is full of inspiring stories and actionable advice. This book is based on 12 years of cubicle living and my true story of cultivating a dream job that changed my life and the world in the process. It's time to close the gap between your day job and your dream job.

Reading Like A Writer,"Long before there were creative-writing workshops and degrees, how did aspiring writers learn to write? By reading the work of their predecessors and contemporaries, says Francine Prose.In Reading Like a Writer, Prose invites you to sit by her side and take a guided tour of the tools and the tricks of the masters. She reads the work of the very best writersâDostoyevsky, Flaubert, Kafka, Austen, Dickens, Woolf, Chekhovâand discovers why their work has endured. She takes pleasure in the long and magnificent sentences of Philip Roth and the breathtaking paragraphs of Isaac Babel; she is deeply moved by the brilliant characterization in George Eliot's Middlemarch. She looks to John Le CarrÃ© for a lesson in how to advance plot through dialogue, to Flannery O'Connor for the cunning use of the telling detail, and to James Joyce and Katherine Mansfield for clever examples of how to employ gesture to create character. She cautions readers to slow down and pay attention to words, the raw material out of which literature is crafted.Written with passion, humor, and wisdom, Reading Like a Writer will inspire readers to return to literature with a fresh eye and an eager heart.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7249832-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23275137M/Reading_like_a_writer;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/reading-like-a-writer-summary/,reading;writing,Francine Prose,,,,,
Real Artists Don’t Starve,"Bestselling author and creativity expert Jeff Goins dismantles the myth that being creative is a hindrance to success by revealing how an artistic temperament is in fact a competitive advantage in the marketplace.The Starving Artist Is a MythWeâve heard it a thousand times: Thereâs no money in art. Itâs too risky. Youâll starve. So, we end up chasing more stable careers. We become lawyers and doctors and bankers instead of poets and filmmakers and painters. We settle. And in the end our best work suffers.The truth is we do not have to choose between a creative life and a prosperous one. In fact, many of historyâs most creative mindsâfrom Michelangelo to Shakespeare to Steve Jobsâsucceeded notÂ because they succumbed to the myth of the starving artist but precisely because they didnât.Today we live in a New Renaissance, an era of unprecedented opportunity in which you can share your creative work without fear of suffering or starving. Drawing lessons from the likes of Jim Henson, C. S. Lewis, Dr. Dre, and many others, bestselling author and entrepreneur Jeff Goins invites us to drop the myths, worries, and flat-out lies that have been drilled into us our entire lives and instead reveals an empowering truth: Real artists donât starve.

Reality Is Broken,"Visionary game designer Jane McGonigal reveals how we can harness the power of games to solve real-world problems and boost global happiness.   More than 174 million Americans are gamers, and the average young person in the United States will spend ten thousand hours gaming by the age of twenty-one. According to world-renowned game designer Jane McGonigal, the reason for this mass exodus to virtual worlds is that videogames are increasingly fulfilling genuine human needs. In this groundbreaking exploration of the power and future of gaming, McGonigal reveals how we can use the lessons of game design to fix what is wrong with the real world.Drawing on positive psychology, cognitive science, and sociology, Reality Is Broken uncovers how game designers have hit on core truths about what makes us happy and utilized these discoveriesto astonishing effect in virtual environments. Videogames consistently provide the exhilarating rewards, stimulating challenges, and epic victories that are so often lacking in the real world. But why, McGonigal asks, should we use the power of games for escapist entertainment alone? Her research suggests that gamers are expert problem solvers and collaborators because they regularly cooperate with other players to overcome daunting virtual challenges, and she helped pioneer a fast-growing genre of games that aims to turn gameplay to socially positive ends.In Reality Is Broken, she reveals how these new alternate reality games are already improving the quality of our daily lives, fighting social problems such as depression and obesity, and addressing vital twenty-first-century challenges-and she forecasts the thrilling possibilities that lie ahead. She introduces us to games like World Without Oil, a simulation designed to brainstorm-and therefore avert- the challenges of a worldwide oil shortage, and Evoke, a game commissioned by the World Bank Institute that sends players on missions to address issues from poverty to climate change.McGonigal persuasively argues that those who continue to dismiss games will be at a major disadvantage in the coming years. Gamers, on the other hand, will be able to leverage the collaborative and motivational power of games in their own lives, communities, and businesses. Written for gamers and nongamers alike, Reality Is Broken shows us that the future will belong to those who can understand, , and play games.Watch a Video",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6680781-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24595354M/Reality_Is_Broken;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/reality-is-broken-summary/,psychology;games;game-design,Jane McGonigal,,,,,

Rejection Proof,"Rejection Proof is Jia Jiang's entertaining and inspiring account of conquering his fear of rejection, offering a completely new perspective on how to turn a no into a yes.Jia Jiang came to the United States with the dream of being the next Bill Gates. Despite early success in the corporate world, his first attempt to pursue his entrepreneurial dream ended in rejection. Jia was crushed and spiraled into a period of deep self-doubt. But he realized that his fear of rejection was a bigger obstacle than any single rejection would ever be, and he needed to find a way to cope with being told no without letting it destroy him. Thus was born his ""100 days of rejection"" experiment, during which he willfully sought rejection on a daily basis - from requesting a lesson in sales from a car salesman (no) to asking a flight attendant if he could make an announcement on the loudspeaker (yes) to his famous request to get Krispy Kreme doughnuts in the shape of Olympic rings (yes, with a viral video to prove it).Jia learned that even the most preposterous wish may be granted if you ask in the right way, and here he shares the secret of successful asking, how to pick targets, and how to tell when an initial no can be converted into something positive. But more important, he learned techniques for steeling himself against rejection and ways to develop his own confidence - a plan that can't be derailed by a single setback.Filled with great stories and valuable insight, Rejection Proof is a fun and thoughtful examination of how to overcome fear and dare to live more boldly.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Rejection-Proof-Became-Invincible-Through/dp/080414138X?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/rejection-proof-summary/,business;psychology;communication,Jia Jiang,,,,,
Rest,"""Rest is such a valuable book. If work is our national religion, Pang is the philosopher reintegrating our bifurcated selves.""---Arianna Huffington, New York Times Book ReviewOverwork is the new normal. Rest is something to do when the important things are done-but they are never done. Looking at different forms of rest, from sleep to vacation, Silicon Valley futurist and business consultant Alex Soojung-Kim Pang dispels the myth that the harder we work the better the outcome. He combines rigorous scientific research with a rich array of examples of writers, painters, and thinkers---from Darwin to Stephen King---to challenge our tendency to see work and relaxation as antithetical. ""Deliberate rest,"" as Pang calls it, is the true key to productivity, and will give us more energy, sharper ideas, and a better life. Rest offers a roadmap to rediscovering the importance of rest in our lives, and a convincing argument that we need to relax more if we actually want to get more done.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/Rest-More-Done-When-Work/dp/1541617169?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/rest-summary/,productivity;health,Author of Rest,,,,,
Rewire,"We humans tend to get in our own way time and time againâwhether it comes to not speaking up for ourselves, going back to bad romantic partners, dieting for the umpteenth try, or acting on any of a range of bad habits we just canât seem to shake. In Rewire, renowned psychotherapist Richard OâConnor, PhD, reveals exactly why our bad habits die so hard. We have two brainsâone a thoughtful, conscious, deliberative self, and the other an automatic self that makes most of our decisions without our attention. Using new research and knowledge about how the brain works, the book clears a path to lasting, effective change for behaviors that include:ProcrastinationOvereatingChronic disorganizationStaying in bad situationsExcessive worryingRisk takingPassive aggressionSelf-medicationBringing together many different fields in psychology and brain science, Dr. OâConnor gives you a road map to overcoming whatever self-destructive habits are plaguing you, with exercises throughout the book. We can rewire our brains to develop healthier circuitry, training the automatic self to make wiser decisions without having to think about it; ignore distractions; withstand temptations; see ourselves and the world more clearly; and interrupt our reflexive responses before they get us in trouble. Meanwhile, our conscious minds will be freed to view ourselves with compassion at the same time as we practice self-discipline. By learning valuable skills and habitsâincluding mindfulness, self-control, confronting fear, and freeing yourself from mindless guiltâwe can open ourselves to vastly more successful, productive, and happy lives. The book even demystifies how to overcome what Dr. OâConnor calls the âundertowâ (the mysterious force that sabotages our best efforts when weâre just on the edge of victory) for long-lasting change. Offering a valuable science-based new paradigm for rewiring our brains, Rewire is a refreshing guide to becoming a healthier, happier self.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Rewire-Overcome-Addictions-Self-Destruc-Behavior/dp/1594632561?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/rewire-summary/,psychology;habits,"O'Connor, Richard (Psychotherapist)",,,,,

Most importantly, she identifies a breed of leaders she refers to as âperpetual rookies.â Despite years of experience, they retain their rookie smarts, thinking and operating with the mindsets and practices of these high-performing rookies.Rookie SmartsÂ addresses the questions every experienced professional faces: âWill my knowledge and skills become obsolete and irrelevant? Will a young, inexperienced newcomer upend my company or me? How can I keep up?â The answer is to stay fresh, keep learning, and know when to think like a rookie.Rookie SmartsÂ isnât just for professionals seeking personal renewal; it is an indispensible resource for all leaders who must ensure their workforces remains vital and competitive.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20663101-rookie-smarts;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/rookie-smarts-summary/,business;leadership;personal-development,Liz Wiseman,,,,,
Rule #1,"Before I became âPhil Town, teacher of investing principles to more than 500,000 people a year,â I was a lot like you: someone who viewed individual stock investing as way too hard to do successfully. As a guy who barely made a living as a river guide, I considered the whole process pretty impenetrable, and I was convinced that to do it right you had to make it a full-time job. Me, I was more interested in having full-time fun.So I was tempted to do what youâre probably doing right now: letting some mutual fund manager worry about growing your nest egg. Let me tell you why that decision could one day make you absolutely miserable. The fact is, because of natural market cycles, the mutual fund industry is likely to soon be facing twenty years of flat returns. That means that if youâve got your nest egg tucked away in fundsâespecially the type found in most 401ksâyour egg wonât get much bigger than it is now. Translation: Get ready for a retirement filled with lots of cold cuts, plenty of quality TV-watching time, and a place to live thatâs too small to accommodate your visiting kids.In this book Iâll show you how I turned $1,000 into $1 million in only five years, and then proceeded to make many millions more. I came to investing as a person who wasnât great at math, possessed zero extra cash, and wanted a lifeânot an extra three hours of work to do every day.Fortunately, I was introduced to The Rule.Rule #1, as famed investor Warren Buffett will tell you, is donât lose money. Through an intriguing process that Iâll clarify in this book, not losing money results in making more money than you ever imagined. What it comes down to is buying shares of companies only when the numbersâand the intangiblesâare on your side. If that sounds too good to be true, itâs because the mind-set Iâll be introducing you to leads not to bets but to certainties. Believe me, if there were anything genius-level about this, Iâd still be a river guide collecting unemployment much of the year.Part of the secret is thinking of yourself as a business owner rather than a stock investor. Part is taking advantage of todayâs new Internet tools, which drastically reduce the âhomework factor.â (Weâre talking a few minutes, tops.) Part is knowing the only five numbers that really count in valuing a potential investment. And partâmaybe the most important partâis using the risk-free Rule #1 approach to consistently pay a mere 50 cents to buy a dollarâs worth of a business.What I wonât waste your time with is fluff: a lot of vague parables reminding you of what you already know and leaving you exactly where you started. This is the real deal, folks: a start-to-finish, one-baby-step-at-a-time approach that will allow you to retire ten years sooner than you planned, with more creature comforts than you ever imagined.Also available as a Random House AudioBook and eBook.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/167749-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Rule-Strategy-Successful-Investing-Minutes/dp/0307336840?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/rule-1-summary/,personal-finance;investing,Phil Town,,,,,

Salt Sugar Fat,"Every year, the average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar. They ingest 8,500 milligrams of salt a day, double the recommended amount, almost none of which comes from salt shakers. It comes from processed food, an industry that hauls in $1 trillion in annual sales.  In Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how this happened. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century--including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, NestlÃ©, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more--Mossâs explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research. He goes inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the ""bliss point"" of sugary beverages or enhance the ""mouth feel"" of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing techniques taken straight from tobacco company playbooks to redirect concerns about the health risks of products. He talks to concerned executives who explain that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: the industry itself would cease to exist without salt, sugar, and fat.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7268208-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Salt-Sugar-Fat-Giants-Hooked/dp/0812982193?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/salt-sugar-fat-summary/,food;health;nutrition,Michael Moss,,,,,

Second Chance,"Few would argue with the fact that, on many fronts, we are a world in crisis. And there are two sides to every crisis, be it a leadership crisis, an economic crisis, an education crisis or a moral crisis. The two side to crisis are danger and opportunity.Robert Kiyosakiâs new book, Second Chanceâ¦for Your Money and Your Life, uses the lessons from the past and a brutal assessment of the present to prepare readers to seeââand seizeââthe future.If readers can train their minds to see what their eyes cannot, in a world that is becoming increasingly more âinvisibleâ and moving at a high rate of speed, they can have a second chance at creating the life theyâve always wanted.The global problems we face cannot be solved by the same minds and people who created them and todayâs world demands the ability to see the future and prepare for what lies aheadâ¦prepare for the opportunities as well as the challenges.Like it or not, we are all involved in the greatest evolutionary event in human history. The Industrial Age is over and the Information Age continues to accelerate. The visible agents of change have become invisibleâ¦and harder to see. And the future belongs to those who can train their minds, use the past to see the future, and take the steps to create the positive change they want to see in their lives.Second Chance is a guide to understanding how the past will shape the future and how you can use Information Age tools and insights to create a fresh start. This book is a guide to facing head-on the dangers of the crises around usâand steps and tips for seizing the opportunities they present.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27199124M/Second_chance;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/second-chance-summary/,personal-finance,Robert T.

Secrets Of The Millionaire Mind,"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it!Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: ""Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!"" Eker does this by identifying your ""money and success blueprint."" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of moneyâand if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and ""revise"" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen ""Wealth Files,"" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6631947-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Secrets-Millionaire-Mind-Mastering-Wealth/dp/0060763280?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/secrets-of-the-millionaire-mind-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/MillionaireMind,personal-finance,T.

Shoe Dog,"In this instant and tenacious New York Times bestseller, Nike founder and board chairman Phil Knight âoffers a rare and revealing look at the notoriously media-shy man behind the swooshâ (Booklist, starred review), opening up about his companyâs early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the worldâs most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.Young, searching, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his car in 1963, Knight grossed eight thousand dollars that first year. Today, Nikeâs annual sales top $30 billion. In this age of start-ups, Knightâs Nike is the gold standard, and its swoosh is more than a logo. A symbol of grace and greatness, itâs one of the few icons instantly recognized in every corner of the world.But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery. In Shoe Dog, he tells his story at last. It all begins with a classic crossroads moment at twenty-four, backpacking across the world, and wrestling with lifeâs Great Questions. Rather than work for a big corporation, Knight decides he will create something all his own, something new, dynamic, different. He details the many terrifying risks he encountered, the crushing setbacks, the ruthless competitors, the countless doubters and haters and hostile bankersâas well as his many thrilling triumphs and narrow escapes. Above all, he recalls the relationships that formed the heart and soul of Nike, with his former track coach, the irascible and charismatic Bill Bowerman, and with his first employees, a ragtag group of misfits and savants who quickly became a band of swoosh-crazed brothers.Together, harnessing the electrifying power of a bold vision and a shared belief in the redemptive, transformative power of sports, they created a brandâand a cultureâthat changed everything.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8184998-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Shoe-Dog-Phil-Knight/dp/1508211809?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/shoe-dog-summary/,business;nike,Author of Shoe Dog,,,,,

Smartcuts,"Entrepreneur and journalist Shane Snow (Wired, Fast Company, The New Yorker, and cofounder of Contently) analyzes the lives of people and companies that do incredible things in implausibly short time.How do some startups go from zero to billions in mere months? How did Alexander the Great, YouTube tycoon Michelle Phan, and Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon climb to the top in less time than it takes most of us to get a promotion? What do high-growth businesses, world-class heart surgeons, and underdog marketers do in common to beat the norm?One way or another, they do it like computer hackers. They employ what psychologists call ""lateral thinking: to rethink convention and break ""rules"" that aren't rules.These are not shortcuts, which produce often dubious short-term gains, but ethical ""smartcuts"" that eliminate unnecessary effort and yield sustainable momentum. In Smartcuts, Snow shatters common wisdom about success, revealing how conventions like ""paying dues"" prevent progress, why kids shouldn't learn times tables, and how, paradoxically, it's easier to build a huge business than a small one.From SpaceX to The Cuban Revolution, from Ferrari to Skrillex, Smartcuts is a narrative adventure that busts old myths about success and shows how innovators and icons do the incredible by working smarterâand how perhaps the rest of us can, too.",https://sivers.org/images/Smartcuts.gif,book|https://www.amazon.in/Smartcuts-Hackers-Innovators-Accelerate-Success/dp/0062302450?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/smartcuts-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/Smartcuts,startups;entrepreneurship;productivity;personal-development, Shane Snow,,,,,
Smarter Faster Better,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - From the author of The Power of Habit comes a fascinating book that explores the science of productivity, and why managing how you think is more important than what you think--with an appendix of real-world lessons to apply to your life.At the core of Smarter Faster Better are eight key productivity concepts--from motivation and goal setting to focus and decision making--that explain why some people and companies get so much done. Drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral economics--as well as the experiences of CEOs, educational reformers, four-star generals, FBI agents, airplane pilots, and Broadway songwriters--this painstakingly researched book explains that the most productive people, companies, and organizations don't merely act differently.They view the world, and their choices, in profoundly different ways.A young woman drops out of a PhD program and starts playing poker. By training herself to envision contradictory futures, she learns to anticipate her opponents' missteps--and becomes one of the most successful players in the world.A group of data scientists at Google embark on a four-year study of how the best teams function, and find that how a group interacts is more important than who is in the group--a principle, it turns out, that also helps explain why Saturday Night Live became a hit.A Marine Corps general, faced with low morale among recruits, reimagines boot camp--and discovers that instilling a ""bias toward action"" can turn even the most directionless teenagers into self-motivating achievers.The filmmakers behind Disney's Frozen are nearly out of time and on the brink of catastrophe--until they shake up their team in just the right way, spurring a creative breakthrough that leads to one of the highest-grossing movies of all time.What do these people have in common?They know that productivity relies on making certain choices. The way we frame our daily decisions; the big ambitions we embrace and the easy goals we ignore; the cultures we establish as leaders to drive innovation; the way we interact with data: These are the things that separate the merely busy from the genuinely productive.In The Power of Habit,  Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charles Duhigg explained why we do what we do. In Smarter Faster Better, he applies the same relentless curiosity, deep reporting, and rich storytelling to explain how we can improve at the things we do. It's a groundbreaking exploration of the science of productivity, one that can help anyone learn to succeed with less stress and struggle, and to get more done without sacrificing what we care about most--to become smarter, faster, and better at everything we do.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733966-smarter-faster-better;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/smarter-faster-better-summary/,thinking;productivity;habits;personal-development,Author of Smarter Faster Better,,,,,

Along the way, he narrates with acidtongued wit his experiences as a human guinea pig, road-testing commercial brain-training programs, learning to play the Renaissance lute, getting physically fit, even undergoing transcranial directcurrent stimulation.Smarter speaks to the audience that made bestsellers out of Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain and Moonwalking with Einstein.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Science-Building-Brain-Power/dp/014218165X?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/smarter-summary/,psychology;science;thinking;neuroscience;learning,Dan Hurley,,,,,

So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed,"Now aÂ  New York Times Â bestseller and from the author of The Psychopath Test, a captivating and brilliant exploration of one of our world's most underappreciated forces: shame.Â 'It's about the terror, isn't it?'Â 'The terror of what?' I said.Â 'The terror of being found out.'Â For the past three years, Jon Ronson has travelled the world meeting recipients of high-profile public shamings. The shamed are people like us - people who, say, made a joke on social media that came out badly, or made a mistake at work. Once their transgression is revealed, collective outrage circles with the force of a hurricane and the next thing they know they're being torn apart by an angry mob, jeered at, demonized, sometimes even fired from their job.Â A great renaissance of public shaming is sweeping our land. Justice has been democratized. The silent majority are getting a voice. But what are we doing with our voice? We are mercilessly finding people's faults. We are defining the boundaries of normality by ruining the lives of those outside it. We are using shame as a form of social control.Â Simultaneously powerful and hilarious in the way only Jon Ronson can be,Â So You've Been Publicly ShamedÂ is a deeply honest book about modern life, full of eye-opening truths about the escalating war on human flaws - and the very scary part we all play in it.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22571552-so-you-ve-been-publicly-shamed;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/so-youve-been-publicly-shamed-summary/,psychology;sociology,Author of So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed,,,,,
Social Intelligence,"Emotional Intelligence was an international phenomenon, appearing on the New York Times bestseller list for over a year and selling more than five million copies worldwide. Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are âwired to connectâ and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives.Far more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodiesâdown to the level of our genesâfor good or ill. In Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a âneural balletâ that connects us brain to brain with those around us.Our reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitaminsâand bad relationships like poisons. We can âcatchâ other peopleâs emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the âdark sideâ of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for âmindsight,â as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.Is there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace? The answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought. And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation, and altruismâprovided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4673315-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26324.Social_Intelligence;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/social-intelligence-summary/,sociology;relationships,Daniel Goleman,,,,,
Solve For Happy,"Mo Gawdat is a remarkable thinker and the Chief Business Officer at Googleâs [X], an elite team of engineers that comprise Googleâs futuristic âdream factory.â Applying his superior skills of logic and problem solving to the issue of happiness, he proposes an algorithm based on an understanding of how the brain takes in and processes joy and sadness. Then he solves for happy.In 2001 Mo Gawdat realized that despite his incredible success, he was desperately unhappy. A lifelong learner, he attacked the problem as an engineer would: examining all the provable facts and scrupulously applying logic. Eventually, his countless hours of research and science proved successful, and he discovered the equation for permanent happiness. Thirteen years later, Moâs algorithm would be put to the ultimate test. After the sudden death of his son, Ali, Mo and his family turned to his equationâand it saved them from despair. In dealing with the horrible loss, Mo found his mission: he would pull off the type of âmoonshotâ goal that he and his colleagues were always aiming forâhe would share his equation with the world and help as many people as possible become happier. In Solve for Happy Mo questions some of the most fundamental aspects of our existence, shares the underlying reasons for suffering, and plots out a step-by-step process for achieving lifelong happiness and enduring contentment. He shows us how to view life through a clear lens, teaching us how to dispel the illusions that cloud our thinking; overcome the brainâs blind spots; and embrace five ultimate truths. No matter what obstacles we face, what burdens we bear, what trials weâve experienced, we can all be content with our present situation and optimistic about the future.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30354426-solve-for-happy;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/solve-for-happy-summary/,psychology;personal-development;happiness,Mo Gawdat,,,,,
Spartan Up,"Since 2006 more than one million people have participated in Spartan Races around the world. In 2014 there will be a race every other day in 15 countries on five continents. What do these Spartans know that you donât? They know that we all have a fire burning within us to prove ourselves. Joe De Sena has captured that invincible Spartan spirit in his manifesto for bold living, SPARTAN UP! A Take-No-Prisoners Guide to Overcoming Obstacles and Achieving Peak Performance in Life (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; May 13, 2014; $24).  De Senaâs prescription for lifeâs insurmountable obstacles is to get off the couch and crush them through hard work and force of will. A legend in the ultramarathon community, he created Spartan Race, extreme obstacle races where no one knows what to expect, but to finish is to be transformed. Spartan Race drives participants to their very limit to learn what they are capable of and to set a new frame of reference; one they can draw upon in the face of lifeâs harshest challenges. Everyday disappointments and setbacks seem small when youâve been to the other side of hell and made it back as a victor. In SPARTAN UP! De Sena paints a picture of how he created the Spartan way of life, beginning with an unexpected challenge by a friend that got him back into shape through endurance racing. After that first race, De Sena completed more than 50 ultramarathons (in conditions ranging from -30 to 120 degrees) and 14 Ironman events, including the 135-mile Badwater ultramarathon, the 140.6 Lake Placid Ironman, and a 100-mile Vermont trail runâin a single week. The harder the race the more he loved it; he was hooked.SPARTAN UP! is more than an insiderâs view of the world of obstacle racing, itâs a manual for the Spartan way of life, including :â¢	Finding the will to succeed: The first half of a race you run with your legs; the second half you run with your mind. Turn your pain into an outboard motor to drive you forward. â¢	Tossing your cookies: The Cookie Test can teach you how to overcome the need for immediate gratification and help you prosper in the long term. â¢	Changing your frame of reference: Reset your inner default as an antidote to dissatisfaction and the insatiable need for âmore.â â¢	Getting Spartan fit: Survival of the Fittest means training outside the gym for strength, endurance and flexibility throughout the entire bodyâand donât forget those burpees! â¢	Moving mountains: Whether metaphorical mountains or the ones on which Spartans race, what you think are your limits can be a mere starting point for transformation. Age, gender, and physical ability are no barrier and finishers become entirely new people, without limitations, living life to the fullest. Thatâs why the Spartans say: âYouâll know at the finish line.â JOE DE SENA is a cofounder of Spartan Race, which began as an obstacle race based on the extreme spirit of the legendary Death Race, and has become a multi-million dollar global lifestyle company in less than 10 years. It was voted Outside magazineâs Best Obstacle Race. In one yearâs time he competed in the Raid International Ukatak in Canada; the IditaSport in Alaska; the Odyssey Adventure Race and the OAR Beast of the East, both in Virginia; the Raid the North Extreme in Newfoundland, the Adrenaline Rush in Ireland and the Discovery Channel World Championships in Switzerland. He resides in Vermont with his family.

Superbetter,"
  An innovative guide to living gamefully, based on the program that has already helped nearly half a million people achieve remarkable personal growth
  
In 2009, internationally renowned game designer Jane McGonigal suffered a severe concussion. Unable to think clearly or work or even get out of bed, she became anxious and depressed, even suicidal. But rather than let herself sink further, she decided to get better by doing what she does best: she turned her recovery process into a resilience-building game. What started as a simple motivational exercise quickly became a set of rules for âpost-traumatic growthâ that she shared on her blog. These rules led to a digital game and a major research study with the National Institutes of Health. Today nearly half a million people have played SuperBetter to get stronger, happier, and healthier.But the life-changing ideas behind SuperBetter are much bigger than just one game. In this book, McGonigal reveals a decadeâs worth of scientific research into the ways all gamesâincluding videogames, sports, and puzzlesâchange how we respond to stress, challenge, and pain. She explains how we can cultivate new powers of recovery and resilience in everyday life simply by adopting a more âgamefulâ mind-set. Being gameful means bringing the same psychological strengths we naturally display when we play gamesâsuch as optimism, creativity, courage, and determinationâto real-world goals.Drawing on hundreds of studies, McGonigal shows that getting superbetter is as simple as tapping into the three core psychological strengths that games help you build:Â Â Â â¢Â Your ability to control your attention, and therefore your thoughts and feelingsÂ Â Â â¢Â Your power to turn anyone into a potential ally, and to strengthen your existing relationshipsÂ Â Â â¢Â Your natural capacity to motivate yourself and super-charge your heroic qualities, like willpower, compassion, and determinationSuperBetter contains nearly 100 playful challenges anyone can undertake in order to build these gameful strengths. It includes stories and data from people who have used the SuperBetter method to get stronger in the face of illness, injury, and other major setbacks, as well as to achieve goals like losing weight, running a marathon, and finding a new job.As inspiring as it is down to earth, and grounded in rigorous research, SuperBetter is a proven game plan for a better life. Youâll never say that something is âjust a gameâ again.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611964-superbetter;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/superbetter-summary/,psychology;game-design;health;personal-development,Jane McGonigal,,,,,
Superfreakonomics,"The New York Times best-selling Freakonomics was a worldwide sensation, selling over four million copies in thirty-five languages and changing the way we look at the world. Now, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner return with SuperFreakonomics, and fans and newcomers alike will find that the freakquel is even bolder, funnier, and more surprising than the first.Four years in the making, SuperFreakonomics asks not only the tough questions, but the unexpected ones: What's more dangerous, driving drunk or walking drunk? Why is chemotherapy prescribed so often if it's so ineffective? Can a sex change boost your salary?SuperFreakonomics challenges the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything with such questions as:How is a street prostitute like a department-store Santa?Why are doctors so bad at washing their hands?How much good do car seats do?What's the best way to catch a terrorist?Did TV cause a rise in crime?What do hurricanes, heart attacks, and highway deaths have in common?Are people hard-wired for altruism or selfishness?Can eating kangaroo save the planet?Which adds more value: a pimp or a Realtor?Levitt and Dubner mix smart thinking and great storytelling like no one else, whether investigating a solution to global warming or explaining why the price of oral sex has fallen so drastically. By examining how people respond to incentives, they show the world for what it really is â good, bad, ugly, and, in the final analysis, super freaky.Freakonomics has been imitated many times over â but only now, with SuperFreakonomics, has it met its match.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7092420-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23712847M/Superfreakonomics;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/superfreakonomics-summary/,economics,Steven D.

Tens of millions of people in business, government, and schools have dramatically improved their lives and organizations by applying the principles of Stephen R.

The ADHD Advantage,"Why ADHD could be the key to your successFor decades physicians delivered the diagnosis of ADHD to patients as bad news and warned them about a lifelong struggle of managing symptoms. But The ADHD Advantage explodes this outlook, showing that some of the most highly successful entrepreneurs, leaders, and entertainers have reached the pinnacle of success not in spite of their ADHD but because of it.Although the ADHD stereotype is someone who canât sit still, in reality people with ADHD are endlessly curious, often adventurous, willing to take smart risks, and unusually resilient. They are creative, visionary, and entrepreneurial. Sharing the stories of highly successful people with ADHD, Dr. Archer offers a vitally important and inspiring new way to recognize ADHD traits in oneself or in oneâs loved ones, and then leverage them to great advantageâwithout drugs.As someone who not only has ADHD himself but also has never used medication to treat it, Dr. Archer understands the condition from a unique standpoint.

The Age of Empathy,"In this thought-provoking book, the acclaimed author of Our Inner Ape examines how empathy comes naturally to a great variety of animals, including humans. Are we our brothers' keepers? Do we have an instinct for compassion? Or are we, as is often assumed, only on earth to serve our own survival and interests?By studying social behaviors in animals, such as bonding, the herd instinct, the forming of trusting alliances, expressions of consolation, and conflict resolution, Frans de Waal demonstrates that animals-and humans-are ""preprogrammed to reach out."" He has found that chimpanzees care for mates that are wounded by leopards, elephants offer ""reassuring rumbles"" to youngsters in distress, and dolphins support sick companions near the water's surface to prevent them from drowning. From day one humans have innate sensitivities to faces, bodies, and voices; we've been designed to feel for one another.De Waal's theory runs counter to the assumption that humans are inherently selfish, which can be seen in the fields of politics, law, and finance. But he cites the public's outrage at the U.S. government's lack of empathy in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as a significant shift in perspective-one that helped Barack Obama become elected and ushered in what perhaps could become an Age of Empathy. Through a better understanding of empathy's survival value in evolution, de Waal suggests, we can work together toward a more just society based on a more generous and accurate view of human nature.Written in layman's prose with a wealth of anecdotes, wry humor, and incisive intelligence, The Age of Empathy is essential reading for our embattled times.""An important and timely message about the biological roots of human kindness.""--Desmond Morris, author of The Naked Ape",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6566245-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6525532-the-age-of-empathy;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-age-of-empathy-summary/,science;psychology;animals;sociology;empathy;anthropology,Frans de Waal,,,,,
The Antidote,"Self-help books don't seem to work. Few of the many advantages of modern life seem capable of lifting our collective mood. Wealthâeven if you can get itâdoesn't necessarily lead to happiness. Romance, family life, and work often bring as much stress as joy. We can't even agree on what ""happiness"" means. So are we engaged in a futile pursuit? Or are we just going about it the wrong way?Looking both east and west, in bulletins from the past and from far afield, Oliver Burkeman introduces us to an unusual group of people who share a single, surprising way of thinking about life. Whether experimental psychologists, terrorism experts, Buddhists, hardheaded business consultants, Greek philosophers, or modern-day gurus, they argue that in our personal lives, and in society at large, it's our constant effort to be happy that is making us miserable. And that there is an alternative path to happiness and success that involves embracing failure, pessimism, insecurity, and uncertaintyâthe very things we spend our lives trying to avoid. Thought-provoking, counterintuitive, and ultimately uplifting, The Antidote is the intelligent person's guide to understanding the much-misunderstood idea of happiness.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8089907-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13721709-the-antidote;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-antidote-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/Antidote,psychology;philosophy,Oliver Burkeman,,,,,
The Art Of Asking,"Rock star, crowdfunding pioneer, and TED speaker Amanda Palmer knows all about asking. Performing as a living statue in a wedding dress, she wordlessly asked thousands of passersby for their dollars. When she became a singer, songwriter, and musician, she was not afraid to ask her audience to support her as she surfed the crowd (and slept on their couches while touring). And when she left her record label to strike out on her own, she asked her fans to support her in making an album, leading to the world's most successful music Kickstarter.Even while Amanda is both celebrated and attacked for her fearlessness in asking for help, she finds that there are important things she cannot ask for-as a musician, as a friend, and as a wife. She learns that she isn't alone in this, that so many people are afraid to ask for help, and it paralyzes their lives and relationships. In this groundbreaking book, she explores these barriers in her own life and in the lives of those around her, and discovers the emotional, philosophical, and practical aspects of The Art Of Asking.Part manifesto, part revelation, this is the story of an artist struggling with the new rules of exchange in the twenty-first century, both on and off the Internet. The Art Of Asking will inspire readers to rethink their own ideas about asking, giving, art, and love.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Art-Asking-Learned-Worrying-People/dp/1455581097?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-art-of-asking-summary/,art;personal-development,Amanda Palmer,,,,,

Â  With the audacious belief that the lifestyles of the world's Blue Zones could be adapted and replicated in towns across North America, Buettner launched the largest preventive health care project in the United States, The Blue Zones City Makeovers, which has impacted the health of millions of Americans since 2009. In The Blue Zones Solution, readers can be inspired by the specific stories of the people, foods, and routines of our healthy elders; understand the role community, family, and naturally healthy habits can play in improving our diet and health; and learn the exact foodsâincluding the 50 superfoods of longevity and dozens of recipes adapted for Western tastes and marketsâthat offer delicious ways to eat your way to optimum health. Throughout the book are lifestyle recommendations, checklists, and stories to help you create your own personal Blue Zones solution.

The Blue Zones,"Bestselling author, longevity expert, and National Geographic Explorer Dan Buettner reports on health, fitness, diet, and aging, drawing on his research from extraordinarily long-lived communities--Blue Zones--around the globe.

His prescriptions for lifestyle, nutrition, outlook, and stress-coping practices will add years to your life and life to your years.The latest Blue Zone is Ikaria, Greece, where strong, sweet wine, family, and a Mediterranean diet all play a role in longer life. Also new in this book is a reading group guide, designed for groups to read about, discuss, and implement many of the simple changes advocated for better health.A long, healthy life is no accident. It begins with good genes, but it also depends on good habits. If you adopt the right lifestyle, experts say, chances are you may live up to a decade longer. Buettner has led teams of researchers across the globe--from Costa Rica to Sardinia, Italy, to Okinawa, Japan and beyond--to uncover the secrets of Blue Zones. He found that the recipe for longevity is deeply intertwined with community, lifestyle, and spirituality. People live longer and healthier by embracing a few simple but powerful habits, and by creating the right community around themselves.

The Botany Of Desire,"Working in his garden one day, Michael Pollan hit pay dirt in the form of an idea: do plants, he wondered, use humans as much as we use them? While the question is not entirely original, the way Pollan examines this complex coevolution by looking at the natural world from the perspective of plants is unique. The result is a fascinating and engaging look at the true nature of domestication. In making his point, Pollan focuses on the relationship between humans and four specific plants: apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes. He uses the history of John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) to illustrate how both the apple's sweetness and its role in the production of alcoholic cider made it appealing to settlers moving west, thus greatly expanding the plant's range. He also explains how human manipulation of the plant has weakened it, so that ""modern apples require more pesticide than any other food crop."" The tulipomania of 17th-century Holland is a backdrop for his examination of the role the tulip's beauty played in wildly influencing human behavior to both the benefit and detriment of the plant (the markings that made the tulip so attractive to the Dutch were actually caused by a virus). His excellent discussion of the potato combines a history of the plant with a prime example of how biotechnology is changing our relationship to nature. As part of his research, Pollan visited the Monsanto company headquarters and planted some of their NewLeaf brand potatoes in his garden--seeds that had been genetically engineered to produce their own insecticide. Though they worked as advertised, he made some startling discoveries, primarily that the NewLeaf plants themselves are registered as a pesticide by the EPA and that federal law prohibits anyone from reaping more than one crop per seed packet. And in a interesting aside, he explains how a global desire for consistently perfect French fries contributes to both damaging monoculture and the genetic engineering necessary to support it. Pollan has read widely on the subject and elegantly combines literary, historical, philosophical, and scientific references with engaging anecdotes, giving readers much to ponder while weeding their gardens. --Shawn Carkonen",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6494497-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41021145-the-botany-of-desire;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-botany-of-desire-summary/,science;food;environment;nature;botany;biology,Michael Pollan,,,,,

The Bulletproof Diet,"In his midtwenties, Dave Asprey was a successful Silicon Valley multimillionaire. He also weighed 300 pounds, despite the fact that he was doing what doctors recommended: eating 1,800 calories a day and working out 90 minutes a day, six times a week. When his excess fat started causing brain fog and food cravings sapped his energy and willpower, Asprey turned to the same hacking techniques that made his fortune to ""hack"" his own biology, investing more than $300,000 and 15 years to uncover what was hindering his energy, performance, appearance, and happiness. From private brain EEG facilities to remote monasteries in Tibet, through radioactive brain scans, blood chemistry work, nervous system testing, and more, he explored traditional and alternative technologies to reach his physical and mental prime. The result? The Bulletproof Diet, an anti-inflammatory program for hunger-free, rapid weight loss and peak performance. The Bulletproof Diet will challengeâand changeâthe way you think about weight loss and wellness. You will skip breakfast, stop counting calories, eat high levels of healthy saturated fat, work out and sleep less, and add smart supplements.In doing so, you'll gain energy, build lean muscle, and watch the pounds melt off. By ditching traditional ""diet"" thinking, Asprey went from being overweight and sick in his twenties to maintaining a 100-pound weight loss, increasing his IQ, and feeling better than ever in his forties. The Bulletproof Diet is your blueprint to a better life.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Bulletproof-Diet-Reclaim-Energy-Upgrade/dp/162336518X?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-bulletproof-diet-summary/,health;food;nutrition,Dave Asprey,,,,,

The Eureka Factor,"In a book perfect for readers of Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit, David Eagleman's Incognito, and Leonard Mlodinow's Subliminal, the cognitive neuroscientists who discovered how the brain has aha momentsâsudden creative insightsâexplain how they happen, when we need them, and how we can have more of them to enrich our lives and empower personal and professional success.Eureka or aha moments are sudden realizations that expand our understanding of the world and ourselves, conferring both personal growth and practical advantage. Such creative insights, as psychological scientists call them, were what conveyed an important discovery in the science of genetics to Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock, the melody of a Beatles ballad to Paul McCartney, and an understanding of the cause of human suffering to the Buddha. But these moments of clarity are not given only to the famous. Anyone can have them.In The Eureka Factor, John Kounios and Mark Beeman explain how insights arise and what the scientific research says about stimulating more of them. They discuss how various conditions affect the likelihood of your having an insight, when insight is helpful and when deliberate methodical thought is better suited to a task, what the relationship is between insight and intuition, and how the brain's right hemisphere contributes to creative thought.Written in a lively, engaging style, this book goes beyond scientific principles to offer productive techniques for realizing your creative potentialâat home and at work. The authors provide compelling anecdotes to illustrate how eureka experiences can be a key factor in your life. Attend a dinner party with Christopher Columbus to learn why we need insights. Go to a baseball game with the director of a classic Disney Pixar movie to learn about one important type of aha moment. Observe the behind-the-scenes arrangements for an Elvis Presley concert to learn why the timing of insights makes them difficult to use but crucial to study.Accessible and compelling, The Eureka Factor is a fascinating look at the human brain and its seemingly infinite capacity to surprise us.Advance praise for The Eureka FactorâThe Eureka Factor is a highly engaging and informative look into the fascinating topic of sudden creative insights. John Kounios and Mark Beeman convincingly show that what once seemed to be a mysterious feature of the human mind is yielding to dramatic advances in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. Combining state-of-the-art research with compelling everyday examples, this book is essential reading for anyone who has ever wondered what makes it possible to experience an âAha' moment.ââDaniel L.

The Four Tendencies,"In this groundbreaking analysis of personality type, bestselling author of Better Than Before and The Happiness Project, Gretchen Rubin reveals the one simple question that will transform what you do at home, at work, and in life.  During her multibook investigation into understanding human nature, Gretchen Rubin realized that by asking the seemingly dry question ""How do I respond to expectations?"" we gain explosive self-knowledge. She discovered that based on their answer, people fit into Four Tendencies: Upholders, Questioners, Obligers, and Rebels. Our Tendency shapes every aspect of our behavior, so using this framework allows us to make better decisions, meet deadlines, suffer less stress, and engage more effectively. More than 600,000 people have taken her online quiz, and managers, doctors, teachers, spouses, and parents already use the framework to help people make significant, lasting change. The Four Tendencies hold practical answers if you've ever thought...Â· People can rely on me, but I can't rely on myself.Â· How can I help someone to follow good advice?Â· People say I ask too many questions.Â· How do I work with someone who refuses to do what I ask or who keeps telling me what to do?With sharp insight, compelling research, and hilarious examples, The Four Tendencies will help you get happier, healthier, more productive, and more creative. It's far easier to succeed when you know what works for you.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Four-Tendencies-Indispensable-Personality-Profiles/dp/1524760919?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-four-tendencies-summary/,psychology;relationships,Gretchen Rubin,,,,,

The Gifts Of Imperfection,"New York Times best-selling author and professor BrenÃ© Brown offers a powerful and inspiring book that explores how to cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to embrace your imperfections and to recognize that you are enough.Each day we face a barrage of images and messages from society and the media telling us who, what, and how we should be. We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection, Brené rown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough, and to go to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave.

After selling more than a million copies of his Book of Awesome series, he now shifts his focus from observation to application. In The Happiness Equation, Pasricha illustrates how to want nothing, do anything, and have everything. If that sounds like a contradiction, you simply havenât unlocked the 9 Secrets to Happiness. Each secret takes a common ideal, flips it on its head, and casts it in a completely new light. Pasricha then goes a step further by providing step-by-step guidelines and hand-drawn scribbles that illustrate exactly how to apply each secret to live a happier life today. Controversial? Maybe. Counterintuitive? Definitely.The Happiness Equation will teach you such principles as: Â· Why success doesnât lead to happinessÂ  Â· How to make more money than a Harvard MBAÂ  Â· Why multitasking is a mythÂ  Â· How eliminating options leads to more choiceThe Happiness Equation is a book that will change how you think about everythingâyour time, your career, your relationships, your family, and, ultimately, of course, your happiness.Â Â ",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22571656-the-happiness-equation;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-happiness-equation-summary/,psychology;happiness,Neil Pasricha,,,,,

The Happiness Of Pursuit,"A remarkable book that will both guide and inspire, The Happiness of Pursuit reveals how anyone can bring meaning into their life by undertaking a quest. Â  When he set out to visit all of the planetâs countries by age thirty-five, compulsive goal seeker Chris Guillebeau never imagined that his journeyâs biggest revelation would be how many people like himself exist â each pursuing a challenging quest.Â  And, interestingly, these quests arenât just travel-oriented.Â  On the contrary, theyâre as diverse as humanity itself.Â  Some involve exploration; others the pursuit of athletic or artistic excellence; still others a battle against injustice or poverty or threats to the environment. Â  Everywhere that Chris visited he found ordinary people working toward extraordinary goals, making daily down payments on their dream.Â  These âquestersâ included a suburban mom pursuing a wildly ambitious culinary project, a DJ producing the worldâs largest symphony, a young widower completing the tasks his wife would never accomplish, and a teenager crossing an entire ocean alone - as well as a do-it-yourselfer tackling M.I.T.âs computer-science course, a nerd turning himself into real-life James Bond, and scores of others writing themselves into the record books.  Â  The more Chris spoke with these strivers, the more he began to appreciate the direct link between questing and long-term happiness -- how going after something in a methodical way enriches our lives -- and he was compelled to complete a comprehensive study of the phenomenon and extract the best advice.Â  In The Happiness of Pursuit he draws on interviews with hundreds of questers, revealing their secret motivations, their selection criteria, the role played by friends and family, their tricks for solving logistics, and the importance of documentation. Â  Equally fascinating is Chrisâ examination of questingâs other side, including questersâ acute awareness of mortality, their struggle against monotony, and their wistful feelings once a quest has succeeded. What happens after the summit is climbed, the painting hung, the endurance record broken, the âat riskâ community saved?Â   Â  A book that challenges each of us to take control â to make our lives be about something while at the same time remaining clear-eyed about the commitment -- The Happiness of Pursuit will inspire readers of every age and aspiration.Â  Itâs a playbook for making your life count.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27170176M/The_happiness_of_pursuit;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-happiness-of-pursuit-summary/,travel;personal-development,Chris Guillebeau,,,,,

The Hidden Life of Trees,"In The Hidden Life of Trees, Peter Wohlleben shares his deep love of woods and forests and explains the amazing processes of life, death, and regeneration he has observed in the woodland and the amazing scientific processes behind the wonders of which we are blissfully unaware. Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group.Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents the science behind the secret and previously unknown life of trees and their communication abilities; he describes how these discoveries have informed his own practices in the forest around him. As he says, a happy forest is a healthy forest, and he believes that eco-friendly practices not only are economically sustainable but also benefit the health of our planet and the mental and physical health of all who live on Earth.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8064205-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Hidden-Life-Trees-Communicate_Discoveries-Secret/dp/1771642483?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-hidden-life-of-trees-summary/,science;environment;nature;biology;trees;forests,Peter Wohlleben,,,,,

The Interpretation Of Dreams,"What are the most common dreams and why do we have them? What does a dream about death mean? What do dreams of swimming, failing, or flying symbolize?First published by Sigmund Freud in 1899, The Interpretation of Dreams considers why we dream and what it means in the larger picture of our psychological lives. Delving into theories of manifest and latent dream content, the special language of dreams, dreams as wish fulfillments, the significance of childhood experiences, and much more, Freud, widely considered the âfather of psychoanalysis,â thoroughly and thoughtfully examines dream psychology. Encompassing dozens of case histories and detailed analyses of actual dreams, this landmark text presents Freudâs legendary work as a tool for comprehending our sleeping experiences.Renowned for translating Freudâs German writings into English, James Stracheyâwith the assistance of Anna Freudâfirst published this edition in 1953. Incorporating all textual alterations made by Freud over a period of thirty years, it remains the most complete translation of the work in print.Completely redesigned and available for the first time in trade paperback",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24062369M/The_interpretation_of_dreams;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-interpretation-of-dreams-summary/,psychology;philosophy;dreams,Sigmund Freud,,,,,

""Hygge is about an atmosphere and an experience,"" Wiking explains. ""It is about being with the people we love. A feeling of home. A feeling that we are safe.""Hygge is the sensation you get when youâre cuddled up on a sofa, in cozy socks under a soft throw, during a storm. Itâs that feeling when youâre sharing comfort food and easy conversation with loved ones at a candlelit table. It is the warmth of morning light shining just right on a crisp blue-sky day.The Little Book of Hygge introduces you to this cornerstone of Danish life, and offers advice and ideas on incorporating it into your own life, such as:Get comfy. Take a break.Be here now. Turn off the phones.Turn down the lights. Bring out the candles.Build relationships. Spend time with your tribe.Give yourself a break from the demands of healthy living.

The Little Book That Still Beats The Market,"In 2005, Joel Greenblatt published a book that is already considered one of the classics of finance literature. In The Little Book that Beats the Market--a New York Times bestseller with 300,000 copies in print--Greenblatt explained how investors can outperform the popular market averages by simply and systematically applying a formula that seeks out good businesses when they are available at bargain prices. Now, with a new Introduction and Afterword for 2010, The Little Book that Still Beats the Market updates and expands upon the research findings from the original book. Included are data and analysis covering the recent financial crisis and model performance through the end of 2009. In a straightforward and accessible style, the book explores the basic principles of successful stock market investing and then reveals the author's time-tested formula that makes buying above average companies at below average prices automatic. Though the formula has been extensively tested and is a breakthrough in the academic and professional world, Greenblatt explains it using 6th grade math, plain language and humor. He shows how to use his method to beat both the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You'll also learn why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone ""knows"" it. While the formula may be simple, understanding why the formula works is the true key to success for investors. The book will take readers on a step-by-step journey so that they can learn the principles of value investing in a way that will provide them with a long term strategy that they can understand and stick with through both good and bad periods for the stock market.As the Wall Street Journal stated about the original edition, ""Mr. Greenblatt...says his goal was to provide advice that, while sophisticated, could be understood and followed by his five children, ages 6 to 15. They are in luck. His 'Little Book' is one of the best, clearest guides to value investing out there.""",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8247775-the-little-book-that-still-beats-the-market;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-little-book-that-still-beats-the-market-summary/,personal-finance;investing,Joel Greenblatt,,,,,

The Messy Middle,"
  Entrepreneur, Chief Product Officer at Adobe, and product advisor to many of today's top start-ups Scott Belsky believes we focus too much on the start and the finish of any project, ignoring the most important part--the messy middle--where success is truly determined.
Creating something from nothing is a volatile journey. The first mile births a new idea into existence, and the final mile is all about letting go. We love talking about starts and finishes, even though the middle stretch is the most important and often the most ignored and misunderstood.Every business or creative project is ""going great"" until it fails--the bumps along the road are endured in isolation. We don't talk about the middle because we're not proud of the turbulence of our own making and the actions we took out of despair. This book sets out to change that.Belsky draws on his experiences building Behance, selling it to and leading product teams at Adobe, and then working as an investor and advisor with companies like Airbnb, Pinterest, Uber, and sweetgreen to distill seven years' worth of vital insights at every stage of building a business. He features examples from some of the most interesting people and teams, from entrepreneurs to writers, from small start-ups to billion-dollar companies transforming their industries.These essential strategies for enduring and optimizing the middle miles will bolster your confidence and fortify your plans to make you Maximize the Middle.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38821038-maximize-the-middle;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-messy-middle-summary/,business;project-management;product-management,Scott Belsky,,,,,

The One-Page Financial Plan,"Whenever I tell people about my job as a financial advisor, the conversation inevitably turns to how hopeless they feel when it comes to dealing with money. More than once, theyâve begged, âJust tell me what to do.âItâs no surprise that even my most successful friends feel confused or paralyzed. Even if they have a shelfful of personal finance books, they donât have time to make sense of all the information available. They donât just want good advice, they want the best adviceâso rather than do the âwrong thing,â they do nothing. Their 401(k) and bank statements pileÂ up, unexamined or maybe even unopened.What they donât realize is that bad calls about money arenât failures; theyâre just what happens when emotional creatures have to make decisions about the future with limited information. What I tell them is that we need to scrap striving for perfection and instead commit to a process of guessing and making adjustments when things go off track. Of course weâre going to make the best guesses we canâbut weâre not going to obsess over getting them exactly right.The fact is, in a single page you can prioritize what you really want in life and figure out how to get there. Thatâs because a great financial plan has nothing to do with what the markets are doing, what your real estate agent is pitching, or the hot stock your brother-in-law told you about. It has everything to do with whatâs most important to you. By now you may be wondering, âWhat about the details? How much do I need to invest each year, and how do I allocate it? How much life insurance do I need?â Donât worry: Iâll cover those topics and many more, sharing strategies that will take the complexity out of them. The most important thing is getting clarity about the big picture so you can cope with the unexpected. Maybe youâll lose the job you thought was secure; youâll take a financial risk that doesnât pan out; youâll have twins when you were only budgeting for one. In other words: Life will happen.But no matter what happens, this book will help you bridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to go.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8976451-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22571526-the-one-page-financial-plan;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-one-page-financial-plan-summary/,personal-finance,Carl Richards Carl Richards,,,,,

The Opposite Of Spoiled,"In the spirit of Wendy Mogelâs The Blessing of a Skinned Knee and Po Bronson and Ashley Merrymanâs Nurture Shock, New York Times âYour Moneyâ columnist Ron Lieber delivers a taboo-shattering manifesto that explains how talking openly to children about money can help parents raise modest, patient, grounded young adults who are financially wise beyond their years.For Ron Lieber, a personal finance columnist and father, good parenting means talking about money with our kids. Children are hyper-aware of money, and they have scores of questions about its nuances. But when parents shy away from the topic, they lose a tremendous opportunityânot just to model the basic financial behaviors that are increasingly important for young adults but also to imprint lessons about what the family truly values.Written in a warm, accessible voice, grounded in real-world experience and stories from families with a range of incomes, The Opposite of Spoiled is both a practical guidebook and a values-based philosophy. The foundation of the book is a detailed blueprint for the best ways to handle the basics: the tooth fairy, allowance, chores, charity, saving, birthdays, holidays, cell phones, checking accounts, clothing, cars, part-time jobs, and college tuition. It identifies a set of traits and virtues that embody the opposite of spoiled, and shares how to embrace the topic of money to help parents raise kids who are more generous and less materialistic.But The Opposite of Spoiled is also a promise to our kids that we will make them better with money than we are. It is for all of the parents who know that honest conversations about money with their curious children can help them become more patient and prudent, but who donât know how and when to start.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Opposite-Spoiled-Raising-Grounded-Generous/dp/0062247026?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-opposite-of-spoiled-summary/,parenting;personal-finance,Ron Lieber,,,,,

The Pomodoro Technique,"Available through bookstores for the first time, the internationally acclaimed time management system that has been used by millions, written by Francesco Cirillo, creator of the Pomodoro Technique.
   
 Francesco Cirillo developed his famed system for improving productivity as a college student thirty years ago. Using a kitchen timer shaped like a pomodoro (Italian for tomato), Cirillo divided the time he spent working on a project into 25-minute intervals, with 5-minute breaks in between, in order to get more done, without interruptions. By grouping a number of pomodoros together, users can tackle a project of any length, and drastically improve their productivity, enhance their focus, and better achieve their goals.Originally self-published, and shared virally online, this new publication of The Pomodoro Technique includes several new chapters on how teams can use the pomodoro method to save time and increase productivity. The process underlying Cirillo's technique includes five stages: planning the day's tasks, tracking your efforts, recording your daily activities, processing what you have done, and visualizing areas for improvement. With this tried and tested method, readers can simplify their work, find out how much time and effort a task really requires, and improve their focus so they can get more done in the same amount of time each day.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18482790-the-pomodoro-technique;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-pomodoro-technique-summary/,productivity;time-management,Francesco Cirillo,,,,,

The Power Of No,"Â Â Â Â  How many times have you heard yourself saying yes to the wrong thingsâoverwhelming requests, bad relationships, time-consuming obligations? How often have you wished you could summon the power to turn them down? This lively, practical guide helps you take back that powerâand shows that a well-placed âNoâ can not only save you time and trouble, it can save your life.Â Â Â Â  Drawing on their own stories as well as feedback from their readers and students, James Altucher and Claudia Azula Altucher clearly show that you have the right to say no: To anything that is hurting you. To standards that no longer serve you. To people who drain you of your creativity and expression. To beliefs that are not true to the real you. When you do, youâll be freed to say a truly powerful âYesâ in your lifeâone that opens the door to opportunities, abundance, and love.",https://sivers.org/images/PowerOfNo.gif,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18595404-the-power-of-no;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-power-of-no-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/PowerOfNo,personal-development,Lucius Annaeus Seneca,,,,,

The Power Of The Other,"An expert on the psychology of leadership and bestselling author of Integrity, Necessary Endings, and Boundaries For Leaders identifies the critical ingredient for personal and professional wellbeing.Most leadership coaching focuses on helping leaders build their skills and knowledge and close performance gaps. These are necessary, but not sufficient. Using evidence from from neuroscience and his work with leaders, Dr. Cloud shows that the best performers draw on another vital resource: personal and professional relationships that fuel growth and help them surpass current limits. Popular wisdom suggests that we should not allow others to have power over us, but the reality is that they do, for better or for worse. Consider the boss who diminishes you through cutting remarks versus one who challenges you to get better. Or the colleague who always seeks the limelight versus the one who gives you the confidence to finish a difficult project. Or the spouse who is honest and supportive versus the one who resents your success. No matter how talented, intelligent, or experienced, the greatest leaders share one commonality: the power of the others in their lives. Combining engaging case studies, persuasive findings from cutting-edge brain research, and examples from his consulting practice, Cloud argues that whether youâre a Navy SEAL or a corporate executive, outstanding performance depends on having the right kind of connections to fuel personal growth and minimize toxic associations and their effects. Presenting a dynamic model of the impact these different kinds of connections produce, Cloud shows readers how to get more from themselves by drawing on the strength and expertise of others. You donât have a choice whether or not others have power in your life, but you can choose what kinds of relationships you want.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27218559M/The_power_of_the_other;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-power-of-the-other-summary/,relationships,Henry Cloud,,,,,

The Practicing Mind,"In those times when we want to acquire a new skill or face a formidable challenge we hope to overcome, what we need most are patience, focus, and discipline, traits that seem elusive or difficult to maintain. In this enticing and practical book, Thomas Sterner demonstrates how to learn skills for any aspect of life, from golfing to business to parenting, by learning to love the process.Early life is all about trial-and-error practice. If we had given up in the face of failure, repetition, and difficulty, we would never have learned to walk or tie our shoes. So why, as adults, do we often give up on a goal when at first we donât succeed? In his study of how we learn (prompted by his pursuit of disciplines such as music and golf), Sterner has found that we have forgotten the principles of practice â the process of picking a goal and applying steady effort to reach it. The methods Sterner teaches show that practice done properly isnât drudgery on the way to mastery but a fulfilling process in and of itself, one that builds discipline and clarity.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7352370-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335864.The_Practicing_Mind;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-practicing-mind-summary/,learning,Thomas M.

The Presence Process,"Why is it so difficult to simply be present? The reason is that our deeply suppressed emotional imprints from childhood â which Eckhart Tolle calls âthe pain-bodyâ â distract from an awareness of the present moment. Weâre not broken and donât need to be healed but rather, our discomfort needs to be integrated. The Presence Process is a journey that guides readers into taking responsibility for our emotional integration. It is a way to consciously grow up and become responsible for determining the quality of our personal experience. The book teaches readers how to exercise authentic personal responsibility in a practical manner and reveals the mechanics that shape the way they feel about their lives. It offers a simple, practical approach to accomplishing and maintaining personal peace in the midst of globally accelerating change, discomfort, conflict, and chaos.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Presence-Process-Journey-Present-Awareness/dp/1897238460?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-presence-process-summary/,spirituality;personal-development;psychology,Michael Brown,,,,,

The Productivity Project,"A fresh, personal, and entertaining exploration of a topic that concerns all of us: how to be more productive at work and in every facet of our lives.Â  Chris Bailey turned down lucrative job offers to pursue a lifelong dreamâto spend a year performing a deep dive experiment into the pursuit of productivity, a subject he had been enamored with since he was a teenager. After obtaining his business degree, he created a blog to chronicle a year-long series of productivity experiments he conducted on himself, where he also continued his research and interviews with some of the worldâs foremost experts, from Charles Duhigg to David Allen. Among the experiments that he tackled: Bailey went several weeks with getting by on little to no sleep; he cut out caffeine and sugar; he lived in total isolation for 10 days; he used his smartphone for just an hour a day for three months; he gained ten pounds of muscle mass; he stretched his work week to 90 hours; a late riser, he got up at 5:30 every morning for three monthsâall the while monitoring the impact of his experiments on the quality and quantity of his work.  Â The Productivity Projectâand the lessons Chris learnedâare the result of that year-long journey. Among the counterintuitive insights Chris Bailey will teach you:  Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  slowing down to work more deliberately; Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  shrinking or eliminating the unimportant;  Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  the rule of three;  Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  striving for imperfection;  Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  scheduling less time for important tasks;  Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  the 20 second rule to distract yourself from the inevitable distractions;  Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  and the concept of productive procrastination. In an eye-opening and thoroughly engaging read, Bailey offers a treasure trove of insights and over 25 best practices that will help you accomplish more.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733994-the-productivity-project;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-productivity-project-summary/,productivity,Author of The Productivity Project,,,,,
The Secret Life of Pronouns,"In The Secret Life of Pronouns, social psychologist and language expert James W. Pennebaker uses his groundbreaking research in computational linguistics-in essence, counting the frequency of words we use-to show that our language carries secrets about our feelings, our self-concept, and our social intelligence. Our most forgettable words, such as pronouns and prepositions, can be the most revealing: their patterns are as distinctive as fingerprints.Using innovative analytic techniques, Pennebaker X-rays everything from John McCain's tweets to the Federalist Papers. Who would have predicted that the high school student who uses too many verbs in her college admissions essay is likely to make lower grades in college? Or that a world leader's use of pronouns could reliably presage whether he will lead his country into war? You'll learn what Lady Gaga and William Butler Yeats have in common, and how Ebenezer Scrooge's syntax hints at his self-deception and repressed emotion in this sprightly, surprising tour of what our words are saying-whether we mean them to or not.",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10890464-the-secret-life-of-pronouns;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-secret-life-of-pronouns-summary/,linguistics;communication,Author of The Secret Life of Pronouns,,,,,

The Self-Made Billionaire Effect,"A study of self-made billionaires reveals the key distinction between âproducersâ and âperformersâ  There are about 800 self-made billionaires in the world today. What enables this elite group to create truly massive value, and what can the rest of us learn from them?  John Sviokla and Mitch Cohen set out to answer this question with the first systematic study of 120 self-made billionaires, including extensive interviews with icons like Steve Case, Mark Cuban, and T. Boone Pickens, Jr. The authors conclude that self-made billionaires aren't necessarily smarter, harder working, or luckier than their peers. The key difference is what they call the âproducerâ mindset, in contrast to the far more common âperformerâ mindset.  Performers strive to excel in well-defined areas, and they are essential to any company. But producers are even more valuable because they redefine what's possible, rather than simply meeting pre-existing goals and standards. Producers think up entirely new products, services, strategies, and business models, with dramatic results.  This book offers fresh stories and insights into producers' habits of mind. It also provides corporate leaders with a new approach to selecting and managing breakthrough talent, and advice about innovation and value creation for aspiring leaders or entrepreneurs.",,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27177381M/The_self-made_billionaire_effect;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-self-made-billionaire-effect-summary/,entrepreneurship,J.

The Sleep Revolution,"We are in the midst of a sleep deprivation crisis, writes Arianna Huffington, the co-founder and editor in chief of The Huffington Post. And this has profound consequences â on our health, our job performance, our relationships and our happiness.What is needed, she boldly asserts, is nothing short of a sleep revolution.Â Only by renewing our relationship with sleep can we take back control of our lives. In her bestsellerÂ Thrive, Arianna wrote aboutÂ our need to redefine success through well-being, wisdom, wonder, and giving.Â Her discussion of the importance of sleep as a gateway to this more fulfilling way of livingÂ struck such a powerful chord that she realized theÂ mystery andÂ transformativeÂ power of sleep called for a fuller investigation.The result is a sweeping, scientifically rigorous, and deeply personal exploration of sleep from all angles, fromÂ the history of sleep, to the role of dreams in our lives,Â to the consequences of sleep deprivation, andÂ the newÂ golden age of sleep science that is revealingÂ the vital role sleep plays inÂ our every waking moment andÂ every aspect of our health âÂ fromÂ weight gain,Â diabetes,Â and heart disease to cancerÂ and Alzheimerâs.InÂ The Sleep Revolution, Arianna shows how our cultural dismissal of sleep as time wasted compromises our health and our decision-making and undermines our work lives,Â our personal lives --Â and even our sex lives.Â She explores all the latest science on what exactly is going on while we sleep and dream.Â She takes on the dangerous sleeping pill industry, and all the ways our addiction to technology disrupts our sleep. She also offers a range of recommendations and tips from leading scientists on how we can get better and more restorative sleep, and harness its incredible power.In today's fast-paced, always-connected,Â perpetually-harriedÂ and sleep-deprived world, our need for a good nightâs sleep is more important â and elusive -- than ever. The Sleep RevolutionÂ both sounds the alarm on our worldwide sleep crisis and provides a detailed road map to the great sleep awakening that can help transform our lives, our communities, and our world.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Revolution-Transforming-Your-Night/dp/110190402X?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-sleep-revolution-summary/,health;psychology;sleep,"Huffington, Arianna Stassinopoulos",,,,,

The Speed Of Trust,"Over two million copies sold.Stephen M. R. Covey shows how trustâand the speed at which it is established with clients, employees, and all stakeholdersâis the single most critical component of a successful leader and organization.Stephen M. R. Covey, widely known as one of the worldâs leading authorities on trust, asserts that it is âthe most overlooked, misunderstood, underutilized asset to enable performance. Its impact, for good or bad, is dramatic and pervasive. Itâs something you canât escape.â Thankfully, itâs is also the thing that can dramatically improve your personal and professional success.Why trust? The simple, often overlooked fact is this: work gets done with and through people. The Speed of Trust offers an unprecedented and eminently practical look at exactly how trust functions in every transaction and every relationshipâfrom the most personal to the broadest, most indirect interaction. It specifically demonstrates how to establish trust intentionally so that you and your organization can forego the time-killing, bureaucratic check-and-balance processes that is so often deployed in lieu of actual trust.This 2018 updated edition includes an insightful afterword by the author which explores ten key reasons why trust is more relevant now than ever beforeâincluding how trust is the new currency of our world today.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4990715-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36076.The_Speed_of_Trust;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-speed-of-trust-summary/,business;leadership;personal-development;relationships,Stephen R.

The Sports Gene,"Now a New York Times Bestseller! With a new chapter added to the paperback.Â In high school, I wondered whether the Jamaican Americans who made our track team so successful might carry some special speed gene from their tiny island. In college, I ran against Kenyans, and wondered whether endurance genes might have traveled with them from East Africa. At the same time, I began to notice that a training group on my team could consist of five men who run next to one another, stride for stride, day after day, and nonetheless turn out five entirely different runners. How could this be?We all knew a star athlete in high school. The one who made it look so easy. He was the starting quarterback and shortstop; she was the all-state point guard and high-jumper. Naturals. Or were they?The debate is as old as physical competition. Are stars like Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, and Serena Williams genetic freaks put on Earth to dominate their respective sports? Or are they simply normal people who overcame their biological limits through sheer force of will and obsessive training?The truth is far messier than a simple dichotomy between nature and nurture. In the decade since the sequencing of the human genome, researchers have slowly begun to uncover how the relationship between biological endowments and a competitorâs training environment affects athleticism. Sports scientists have gradually entered the era of modern genetic research.In this controversial and engaging exploration of athletic success, Sports Illustrated senior writer David Epstein tackles the great nature vs. nurture debate and traces how far science has come in solving this great riddle. He investigates the so-called 10,000-hour rule to uncover whether rigorous and consistent practice from a young age is the only route to athletic excellence.Along the way, Epstein dispels many of our perceptions about why top athletes excel. He shows why some skills that we assume are innate, like the bullet-fast reactions of a baseball or cricket batter, are not, and why other characteristics that we assume are entirely voluntary, like an athleteâs will to train, might in fact have important genetic components.This subject necessarily involves digging deep into sensitive topics like race and gender. Epstein explores controversial questions such as:Are black athletes genetically predetermined to dominate both sprinting and distance running, and are their abilities influenced by Africaâs geography?Are there genetic reasons to separate male and female athletes in competition?Should we test the genes of young children to determine if they are destined for stardom?Can genetic testing determine who is at risk of injury, brain damage, or even death on the field?Through on-the-ground reporting from below the equator and above the Arctic Circle, revealing conversations with leading scientists and Olympic champions, and interviews with athletes who have rare genetic mutations or physical traits, Epstein forces us to rethink the very nature of athleticism.Â ",,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16171221-the-sports-gene;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-sports-gene-summary/,sports;fitness;health,David J.

The Talent Code,"What is the secret of talent? How do we unlock it? In this groundbreaking work, journalist and New York Times bestselling author Daniel Coyle provides parents, teachers, coaches, businesspeopleâand everyone elseâwith tools they can use to maximize potential in themselves and others. Whether you're coaching soccer or teaching a child to play the piano, writing a novel or trying to improve your golf swing, this revolutionary book shows you how to grow talent by tapping into a newly discovered brain mechanism.Drawing on cutting-edge neurology and firsthand research gathered on journeys to nine of the world's talent hotbedsâfrom the baseball fields of the Caribbean to a classical-music academy in upstate New YorkâCoyle identifies the three key elements that will allow you to develop your gifts and optimize your performance in sports, art, music, math, or just about anything. â¢ Deep Practice--Everyone knows that practice is a key to success. What everyone doesn't know is that specific kinds of practice can increase skill up to ten times faster than conventional practice.â¢ Ignition--We all need a little motivation to get started. But what separates truly high achievers from the rest of the pack? A higher level of commitmentâcall it passionâborn out of our deepest unconscious desires and triggered by certain primal cues. Understanding how these signals work can help you ignite passion and catalyze skill development.â¢ Master Coaching--What are the secrets of the world's most effective teachers, trainers, and coaches? Discover the four virtues that enable these ""talent whisperers"" to fuel passion, inspire deep practice, and bring out the best in their students.These three elements work together within your brain to form myelin, a microscopic neural substance that adds vast amounts of speed and accuracy to your movements and thoughts. Scientists have discovered that myelin might just be the holy grail: the foundation of all forms of greatness, from Michelangelo's to Michael Jordan's. The good news about myelin is that it isn't fixed at birth; to the contrary, it grows, and like anything that grows, it can be cultivated and nourished. Combining revelatory analysis with illuminating examples of regular people who have achieved greatness, this book will not only change the way you think about talent, but equip you to reach your own highest potential.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8725568-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Talent-Code-Greatness-Born-Grown/dp/055380684X?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-talent-code-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/TalentCode,personal-development,Daniel Coyle,,,,,

Wonderland,"""A house of wonders itself. . . . Wonderland inspires grins and well-what-d'ya-knows"" âThe New York Times Book Review From the New York Times-bestselling author of How We Got to Now and Where Good Ideas Come From, a look at the world-changing innovations we made while keeping ourselves entertained. This lushly illustrated history of popular entertainment takes a long-zoom approach, contending that the pursuit of novelty and wonder is a powerful driver of world-shaping technological change. Steven Johnson argues that, throughout history, the cutting edge of innovation lies wherever people are working the hardest to keep themselves and others amused.Johnson's storytelling is just as delightful as the inventions he describes, full of surprising stops along the journey from simple concepts to complex modern systems. He introduces us to the colorful innovators of leisure: the explorers, proprietors, showmen, and artists who changed the trajectory of history with their luxurious wares, exotic meals, taverns, gambling tables, and magic shows.In Wonderland, Johnson compellingly argues that observers of technological and social trends should be looking for clues in novel amusements.

The Third Wave,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER One of Americaâs most accomplished entrepreneursâa pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of businessâshares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Caseâs career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985. At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success, and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOLâs merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world.  In The Third Wave, which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title, and whose work inspired him as a young man), Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies.  We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the âThird Waveâ of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, weâre entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major âreal worldâ sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and foodâand in the process change the way we live our daily lives. But success in the Third Wave will require a different skill set, and Case outlines the path forward.  The Third Wave is part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future. With passion and clarity, Case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies (a growing number of which, he argues, will not be based in Silicon Valley) will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategiesâand how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7882460-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26198708M/The_third_wave;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-third-wave-summary/,internet;history;technology,Steve Case,,,,,

The Upside Of Irrationality,"The provocative follow-up to the New York Times bestseller Predictably Irrational Why can large bonuses make CEOs less productive?How can confusing directions actually help us?Why is revenge so important to us?Why is there such a big difference between what we think will make us happy and what really makes us happy? In his groundbreaking book Predictably Irrational, social scientist Dan Ariely revealed the multiple biases that lead us into making unwise decisions. Now, in The Upside of Irrationality, he exposes the surprising negative and positive effects irrationality can have on our lives. Focusing on our behaviors at work and in relationships, he offers new insights and eye-opening truths about what really motivates us on the job, how one unwise action can become a long-term habit, how we learn to love the ones we're with, and more. Drawing on the same experimental methods that made Predictably Irrational one of the most talked-about bestsellers of the past few years, Ariely uses data from his own original and entertaining experiments to draw arresting conclusions about howÂand whyÂwe behave the way we do. From our office attitudes, to our romantic relationships, to our search for purpose in life, Ariely explains how to break through our negative patterns of thought and behavior to make better decisions.

The Willpower Instinct," One of the world's most esteemed and influential psychologists, Roy F. Baumeister, teams with New York Times science writer John Tierney to reveal the secrets of self-control and how to master it. In Willpower, the pioneering researcher Roy F. Baumeister collaborates with renowned New York Times science writer John Tierney to revolutionize our understanding of the most coveted human virtue: self-control.In what became one of the most cited papers in social science literature, Baumeister discovered that willpower actually operates like a muscle: it can be strengthened with practice and fatigued by overuse. Willpower is fueled by glucose, and it can be bolstered simply by replenishing the brain's store of fuel. That's why eating and sleeping- and especially failing to do either of those-have such dramatic effects on self-control (and why dieters have such a hard time resisting temptation).Baumeister's latest research shows that we typically spend four hours every day resisting temptation. No wonder people around the world rank a lack of self-control as their biggest weakness. Willpower looks to the lives of entrepreneurs, parents, entertainers, and artists-including David Blaine, Eric Clapton, and others-who have flourished by improving their self-control.The lessons from their stories and psychologists' experiments can help anyone. You learn not only how to build willpower but also how to conserve it for crucial moments by setting the right goals and using the best new techniques for monitoring your progress. Once you master these techniques and establish the right habits, willpower gets easier: you'll need less conscious mental energy to avoid temptation. That's neither magic nor empty self-help sloganeering, but rather a solid path to a better life.Combining the best of modern social science with practical wisdom, Baumeister and Tierney here share the definitive compendium of modern lessons in willpower. As our society has moved away from the virtues of thrift and self-denial, it often feels helpless because we face more temptations than ever. But we also have more knowledge and better tools for taking control of our lives. However we define happiness-a close- knit family, a satisfying career, financial security-we won't reach it without mastering self-control.",https://sivers.org/images/WillpowerInstinct.gif,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10865206-the-willpower-instinct;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-willpower-instinct-summary/;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/willpower-summary/;summary|https://www.amazon.in/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/0143122231?tag=learnawesome-21,psychology;personal-development,Author of The Willpower Instinct;Roy F.

Nothing quite compares to sitting down with a young child and hearing the sound of John Williamsâs score as those beloved golden letters fill the screen. In this fun, erudite, and often moving book, Cass R. Sunstein explores the lessons of Star Wars as they relate to childhood, fathers, the Dark Side, rebellion, and redemption. As it turns out, Star Wars also has a lot to teach us about constitutional law, economics, and political uprisings.In rich detail, Sunstein tells the story of the filmsâ wildly unanticipated success and explores why some things succeed while others fail. Ultimately, Sunstein argues, Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down.

The Yes Brain,"From the authors of The Whole-Brain Child and No-Drama Discipline,  an indispensable guide to unlocking your child's innate capacity for resilience, compassion, and creativity.When facing contentious issues such as screen time, food choices, and bedtime, children often act out or shut down, responding with reactivity instead of receptivity. This is what New York Times bestselling authors Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson call a No Brain response. But our kids can be taught to approach life with openness and curiosity. When kids work from a Yes Brain, they're more willing to take chances and explore. They're more curious and imaginative. They're better at relationships and handling adversity. In The Yes Brain, the authors give parents skills, scripts, and activities to bring kids of all ages into the beneficial ""yes"" state. You'll learn- the four fundamentals of the Yes Brain--balance, resilience, insight, and empathy--and how to strengthen them - the key to knowing when kids need a gentle push out of a comfort zone vs. needing the ""cushion"" of safety and familiarity - strategies for navigating away from negative behavioral and emotional states (aggression and withdrawal) and expanding your child's capacity for positivityThe Yes Brain is an essential tool for nurturing positive potential and keeping your child's inner spark glowing and growing strong.Praise for The Yes Brain""This unique and exciting book shows us how to help children embrace life with all of its challenges and thrive in the modern world. Integrating research from social development, clinical psychology, and neuroscience, it's a veritable treasure chest of parenting insights and techniques.""--Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., author of 
  Mindset
 ""I have never read a better, clearer explanation of the impact parenting can have on a child's brain and personality.""--Michael Thompson, Ph.D.""Easily assimilated and informative, the book will help adults enable children to lead physically and emotionally satisfying and well-rounded lives filled with purpose and meaningful relationships. Edifying, easy-to-understand scientific research that shows the benefits that accrue when a child is encouraged to be inquisitive, spirited, and intrepid.""

Theory U,"Access the deepest source of inspiration and vision We live in a time of massive institutional failure that manifests in the form of three major divides: the ecological, the social, and the spiritual. Addressing these challenges requires a new consciousness and collective leadership capacity. In this groundbreaking book, Otto Scharmer invites us to see the world in new ways and in so doing discover a revolutionary approach to learning and leadership. In most large systems today, we collectively create results that no one wants. What keeps us stuck in such patterns of the past? It's our blind spot, that is, our lack of awareness of the inner place from which our attention and intention originate. By moving through Scharmer's U process, we consciously access the blind spot and learn to connect to our authentic Self--the deepest source of knowledge and inspiration. Theory U offers a rich diversity of compelling stories, examples, exercises, and practices that allow leaders, organizations, and larger systems to cosense and coshape the future that is wanting to emerge. This second edition features a new preface in which Scharmer identifies five transformational trends and describes U process case stories around the world. There are also eight color drawings by Kelvy Bird that capture U journey applications and illustrate the concepts in the book, as well as new resources for applying the principles and practices.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8888188-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27427612M/Theory_U;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/theory-u-summary/,leadership;business;management,Otto Scharmer,,,,,

Think Like A Freak,"The New York Times bestselling Freakonomics changed the way we see the world, exposing the hidden side of just about everything. Then came SuperFreakonomics, a documentary film, an award-winning podcast, and more.Now, with Think Like a Freak, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have written their most revolutionary book yet. With their trademark blend of captivating storytelling and unconventional analysis, they take us inside their thought process and teach us all to think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationallyâto think, that is, like a Freak.Levitt and Dubner offer a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems, whether your interest lies in minor lifehacks or major global reforms. As always, no topic is off-limits. They range from business to philanthropy to sports to politics, all with the goal of retraining your brain. Along the way, youâll learn the secrets of a Japanese hot-dog-eating champion, the reason an Australian doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, and why Nigerian e-mail scammers make a point of saying theyâre from Nigeria.Some of the steps toward thinking like a Freak:First, put away your moral compassâbecause itâs hard to see a problem clearly if youâve already decided what to do about it.Learn to say âI donât knowââfor until you can admit what you donât yet know, itâs virtually impossible to learn what you need to.Think like a childâbecause youâll come up with better ideas and ask better questions.Take a master class in incentivesâbecause for better or worse, incentives rule our world.Learn to persuade people who donât want to be persuadedâbecause being right is rarely enough to carry the day.Learn to appreciate the upside of quittingâbecause you canât solve tomorrowâs problem if you arenât willing to abandon todayâs dud.Levitt and Dubner plainly see the world like no one else. Now you can too. Never before have such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealingâand so much fun to read.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Think-Like-Freak-Authors-Freakonomics/dp/0062218344?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/think-like-a-freak-summary/,thinking,Steven D.

This Is Marketing,"
  Real marketing isn't about racking up clicks and tweets; it's about connection, empathy, and making a difference.
Over the past quarter century, Seth Godin has taught and inspired millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, leaders, and fans from all walks of life, via his blog, online courses, lectures, and bestselling books. He is the inventor of countless ideas and phrases that have made their way into mainstream business language, from Permission Marketing to Purple Cow to Tribes to The Dip.Now, for the first time, Godin offers the core of his marketing wisdom in one accessible, timeless package. At the heart of his approach is a big idea: Great marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems. They don't just make noise; they make the world better. Truly powerful marketing is grounded in empathy, generosity, and emotional labor.This book teaches you how to identify your smallest viable audience; draw on the right signals and signs to position your offering; build trust and permission with your target market; speak to the narratives your audience tells themselves about status, affiliation, and dominance; spot opportunities to create and release tension; and give people the tools to achieve their goals.It's time for marketers to stop lying, spamming, and feeling guilty about their work. It's time to stop confusing social media metrics with true connections. It's time to stop wasting money on stolen attention that won't pay off in the long run. THIS IS MARKETING offers a better approach that will still apply for decades to come, no matter how the tactics of marketing continue to evolve.",https://sivers.org/images/ThisIsMarketing.gif,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26977632M/This_is_marketing;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/this-is-marketing-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/ThisIsMarketing,marketing,Seth Godin,,,,,

To Sell Is Human,"From the bestselling author of Drive and A Whole New Mind comes a surprising--and surprisingly useful--new book that explores the power of selling in our lives.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, one in nine Americans works in sales. Every day more than fifteen million people earn their keep by persuading someone else to make a purchase.But dig deeper and a startling truth emerges:Yes, one in nine Americans works in sales. But so do the other eight.Whether weâre employees pitching colleagues on a new idea, entrepreneurs enticing funders to invest, or parents and teachers cajoling children to study, we spend our days trying to move others. Like it or not, weâre all in sales now.To SellÂ Is Human offers a fresh look at the art and science of selling. As he did in Drive and A Whole New Mind,Â Daniel H. Pink draws on a rich trove of social science for his counterintuitive insights. He reveals the new ABCs of moving others (it's no longer ""Always Be Closing""), explains why extraverts don't make the best salespeople, and shows how giving people an ""off-ramp"" for their actions can matter more than actually changing their minds.Along the way, Pink describes the six successors to the elevator pitch, the three rules for understanding another's perspective, the five frames that can make your message clearer and more persuasive, and much more. The result is a perceptive and practical book--one that will change how you see the world and transform what you do at work, at school, and at home.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7498958-M.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13593553-to-sell-is-human;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/to-sell-is-human-summary/,sales;personal-development,Daniel H.

Tribes,"A tribe is any group of people, large or small, who are connected to one another, a leader, and an idea. For millions of years, humans have been seeking out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). It's our nature.Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. All those blogs and social networking sites are helping existing tribes get bigger. But more important, they're enabling countless new tribes to be bornâgroups of ten or ten thousand or ten million who care about their iPhones, or a political campaign, or a new way to fight global warming. And so the key question: Who is going to lead us?The Web can do amazing things, but it can't provide leadership. That still has to come from individualsâpeople just like you who have passion about something. The explosion in tribes means that anyone who wants to make a difference now has the tools at her fingertips.If you think leadership is for other people, think againâleaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma leads a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, runs her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead.If you ignore this opportunity, you risk turning into a ""sheepwalker""âsomeone who fights to protect the status quo at all costs, never asking if obedience is doing you (or your organization) any good. Sheepwalkers don't do very well these days.Tribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers. . . . It's not easy, but it's easier than you think.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3371417-M.jpg,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL16909900M/Tribes;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/tribes-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/Tribes,leadership,Seth Godin,,,,,

Trying Not To Try,"A deeply original exploration of the power of spontaneityâan ancient Chinese ideal that cognitive scientists are only now beginning to understandâand why it is so essential to our well-beingÂ  Why is it always hard to fall asleep the night before an important meeting? Or be charming and relaxed on a first date? What is it about a politician who seems wooden or a comedian whose jokes fall flat or an athlete who chokes? In all of these cases, striving seems to backfire.  Â  In Trying Not To Try, Edward Slingerland explains why we find spontaneity so elusive, and shows how early Chinese thought points the way to happier, more authentic lives. Weâve long been told that the way to achieve our goals is through careful reasoning and conscious effort. But recent research suggests that many aspects of a satisfying life, like happiness and spontaneity, are best pursued indirectly. The early Chinese philosophers knew this, and they wrote extensively about an effortless way of being in the world, which they called wu-wei (ooo-way). They believed it was the source of all success in life, and they developed various strategies for getting it and hanging on to it.  Â  With clarity and wit, Slingerland introduces us to these thinkers and the marvelous characters in their texts, from the butcher whose blade glides effortlessly through an ox to the wood carver who sees his sculpture simply emerge from a solid block. Slingerland uncovers a direct line from wu-wei to the Force in Star Wars, explains why wu-wei is more powerful than flow, and tells us what it all means for getting a date. He also shows how new research reveals whatâs happening in the brain when weâre in a state of wu-weiâwhy it makes us happy and effective and trustworthy, and how it might have even made civilization possible.  Â  Through stories of mythical creatures and drunken cart riders, jazz musicians and Japanese motorcycle gangs, Slingerland effortlessly blends Eastern thought and cutting-edge science to show us how we can live more fulfilling lives. Trying Not To Try is mind-expanding and deeply pleasurable, the perfect antidote to our striving modern culture.",,book|https://www.amazon.com/Trying-Not-Try-Science-Spontaneity/dp/0770437613?tag=learnawesome-20;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/trying-not-to-try-summary/,productivity;philosophy;personal-development,Edward G.

Uncertainty,"Jonathan Fields knows the risks-and potential power-of uncertainty. He gave up a six-figure income as a lawyer to make $12 an hour as a personal trainer. Then, married with a 3-month old baby, he signed a lease to launch a yoga center in the heart of New York City. . . the day before 9/11. But he survived, and along the way he developed a fresh approach to transforming uncertainty, risk of loss, and exposure to judgment into catalysts for innovation, creation, and achievement.Properly understood and harnessed, fear and uncertainty can become fuel for creative genius rather than sources of pain, anxiety, and suffering. In business, art, and life, creating on a world-class level demands bold action and leaps of faith in the face of great uncertainty. But that uncertainty can lead to fear, anxiety, paralysis, and destruction. It can gut creativity and stifle innovation. It can keep you from taking the risks necessary to do great work and craft a deeply-rewarding life. And it can bring companies that rely on innovation grinding to a halt.That is, unless you know how to use it to your advantage. Fields draws on leading-edge technology, cognitive-science and ancient awareness-focusing techniques in a fresh, practical, non-dogmatic way. His approach enables creativity and productivity on an entirely different level and can turn the once-tortuous journey into a more enjoyable quest. Fields will reveal how to:Make changes to your workflow that unlock buried creative potential. Build ""creation hives"" -- supportive groups that can supercharge and humanize the process. Tap social technology and user co-creation to add clarity, certainty, and sanity, even if you're an artist or solo-creator. Develop a set of personal practices and mindset shifts that let you not just tolerate, but invite and even amplify, uncertainty as a catalyst for genius.Drawing on extensive case studies and research, Fields shares a set of detailed personal practices and environmental changes that can not only humanize the creative process, but also allow individuals and teams to stay more open to opportunity and play a bigger creative game.",https://sivers.org/images/LivingBeautifully.gif,book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24853616M/Uncertainty;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/uncertainty-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/LivingBeautifully,risk;personal-development,Jonathan Fields,,,,,

What If - Summary by FourMinuteBooks,"Randall Munroe left NASA in 2005 to start up his hugely popular site XKCD 'a web comic of romance, sarcasm, math and language' which offers a witty take on the world of science and geeks. It now has 600,000 to a million page hits daily. Every now and then, Munroe would get emails asking him to arbitrate a science debate. 'My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning, and we agreed that you should resolve it . . . ' He liked these questions so much that he started up What If. If your cells suddenly lost the power to divide, how long would you survive? How dangerous is it, really, to be in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm? If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms, how much power could we produce? What if everyone only had one soulmate?When (if ever) did the sun go down on the British empire?  How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?What would happen if the moon went away?In pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified military research memos, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, studded with memorable cartoons and infographics. They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind, or at least a really big explosion. Far more than a book for geeks, WHAT IF: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions explains the laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much the smarter for having read.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9189561-M.jpg,summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/what-if-summary/;book|https://www.amazon.in/What-International-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/0544456866?tag=learnawesome-21,science,Randall Munroe,,,,,

When,"Daniel H. Pink, the #1 bestselling author of Drive and To Sell Is Human, unlocks the scientific secrets to good timing to help you flourish at work, at school, and at home.Everyone knows that timing is everything. But we don't know much about timing itself. Our lives are a never-ending stream of ""when"" decisions: when to start a business, schedule a class, get serious about a person. Yet we make those decisions based on intuition and guesswork.Timing, it's often assumed, is an art. In When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing, Pink shows that timing is really a science.Drawing on a rich trove of research from psychology, biology, and economics, Pink reveals how best to live, work, and succeed. How can we use the hidden patterns of the day to build the ideal schedule? Why do certain breaks dramatically improve student test scores? How can we turn a stumbling beginning into a fresh start? Why should we avoid going to the hospital in the afternoon? Why is singing in time with other people as good for you as exercise? And what is the ideal time to quit a job, switch careers, or get married?In When, Pink distills cutting-edge research and data on timing and synthesizes them into a fascinating, readable narrative packed with irresistible stories and practical takeaways that give readers compelling insights into how we can live richer, more engaged lives.",https://sivers.org/images/WhenThingsFallApart.gif,book|https://www.amazon.in/When-Scientific-Secrets-Perfect-Timing/dp/0735210624?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/when-summary/;summary|https://sivers.org/book/WhenThingsFallApart,time-management;personal-development;productivity,Daniel H.

Why We Love,"A groundbreaking exploration of our most complex and mysterious emotionElation, mood swings, sleeplessness, and obsessionÃ¢â¬âthese are the tell-tale signs of someone in the throes of romantic passion. In this revealing new book, renowned anthropologist Helen Fisher explains why this experienceÃ¢â¬âwhich cuts across time, geography, and genderÃ¢â¬âis a force as powerful as the need for food or sleep.Why We Love begins by presenting the results of a scientific study in which Fisher scanned the brains of people who had just fallen madly in love. She proves, at last, what researchers had only suspected: when you fall in love, primordial areas of the brain Ã¢â¬Ålight upÃ¢â¬ with increased blood flow, creating romantic passion. Fisher uses this new research to show exactly what you experience when you fall in love, why you choose one person rather than another, and how romantic love affects your sex drive and your feelings of attachment to a partner. She argues that all animals feel romantic attraction, that love at first sight comes out of nature, and that human romance evolved for crucial reasons of survival. Lastly, she offers concrete suggestions on how to control this ancient passion, and she optimistically explores the future of romantic love in our chaotic modern world.Provocative, enlightening, and persuasive, Why We Love offers radical new answers to the age-old question of what love is and thus provides invaluable new insights into keeping love alive.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/580848-M.jpg,book|https://www.amazon.in/Why-We-Love-Chemistry-Romantic/dp/0805069135?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/why-we-love-summary/,psychology;relationships;love;anthropology,Helen Fisher,,,,,
Why We Work,"An eye-opening, groundbreaking tour of the purpose of work in our lives, showing how work operates in our culture and how you can find your own path to happiness in the workplace.Why do we work? The question seems so simple. But Professor Barry Schwartz proves that the answer is surprising, complex, and urgent.Weâve long been taught that the reason we work is primarily for a paycheck. In fact, weâve shaped much of the infrastructure of our society to accommodate this belief. Then why are so many people dissatisfied with their work, despite healthy compensation? And why do so many people find immense fulfillment and satisfaction through âmenialâ jobs? Schwartz explores why so many believe that the goal for working should be to earn money, how we arrived to believe that paying workers more leads to better work, and why this has made our society confused, unhappy, and has established a dangerously misguided system.Through fascinating studies and compelling anecdotes, this book dispels this myth. Schwartz takes us through hospitals and hair salons, auto plants and boardrooms, showing workers in all walks of life, showcasing the trends and patterns that lead to happiness in the workplace. Ultimately, Schwartz proves that the root of what drives us to do good work can rarely be incentivized, and that the cause of bad work is often an attempt to do just that.How did we get to this tangled place? How do we change the way we work? With great insight and wisdom, Schwartz shows us how to take our first steps toward understanding, and empowering us all to find great work.",,book|https://www.amazon.in/Why-We-Work-Barry-Schwartz/dp/144237814X?tag=learnawesome-21;summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/why-we-work-summary/,psychology;philosophy;leadership;personal-development;sociology;culture;work,"Schwartz, Barry",,,,,

Masala Lab ,"Ever wondered why your grandmother threw a teabag into the pressure cooker while boiling chickpeas, or why she measured using the knuckle of her index finger? Why does a counter-intuitive pinch of salt make your kheer more intensely flavourful? What is the Maillard reaction and what does it have to do with fenugreek? What does your high-school chemistry knowledge, or what you remember of it, have to do with perfectly browning your onions?
Masala Lab by Krish Ashok is a science nerd’s exploration of Indian cooking with the ultimate aim of making the reader a better cook and turning the kitchen into a joyful, creative playground for culinary experimentation. Just like memorizing an equation might have helped you pass an exam but not become a chemist, following a recipe without knowing its rationale can be a sub-optimal way of learning how to cook.

Exhaustively tested and researched, and with a curious and engaging approach to food, Krish Ashok puts together the one book the Indian kitchen definitely needs, proving along the way that your grandmother was right all along.","",video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6-NqgCwDfY;book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54968807-masala-lab,cooking,"",,,,,
Teaching symmetry in the introductory physics curriculum,"Modern physics is largely defined by fundamental symmetry principles and Noether’s theorem. Yet these are not taught, or rarely mentioned, to beginning students, thus missing an opportunity to reveal that the subject of physics is as lively and contemporary as molecular biology, and as beautiful as the arts. We prescribe a symmetry module, of a week’s length, to insert into the curriculum.","",research_paper|https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.1321816,noethers-theorem;physics,"",,,,,

NCERT Math syllabus: Grade 1 to 5,"Make sure to read the ""General Points for Textbook Writers"" in the linked doc because that explains the philosophy of why this syllabus is designed this way and how it should be executed. For example, they've taken a thumb rule o 140 classes o 30-40 minutes each per year. They also say that sequencing of concepts should not be linear, but spiral. They also emphasise the need for students to articulate their reason which is an important aspect of meta-cognition which is known to be crucial for effective learning.

Mathematical Circles (Russian Experience),"It is a book produced by a remarkable cultural circumstance in the former Soviet Union which fostered the creation of groups of students, teachers, and mathematicians called ""Mathematical Circles"". The work is predicated on the idea that studying mathematics can generate the same enthusiasm as playing a team sport-without necessarily being competitive. This book is intended for both students and teachers who love mathematics and want to study its various branches beyond the limits of the school curriculum. It is also a book of mathematical recreations and, at the same time, a book containing vast theoretical and problem material in main areas of what authors consider to be ""extracurricular mathematics"".",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1429635997l/25401568.jpg,book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25401568-mathematical-circles,mathematics,"",,intermediate,,,
